gaHealth: An Englishâ€“Irish Bilingual Corpus of Health Data

To assess the merits of using in-domain data, a dataset for the specific domain of health was developed for the low-resource English to Irish language pair. Our study outlines the process used in developing the corpus and empirically demonstrates the benefits of using an in-domain dataset for the health domain. In the context of translating health-related data, models developed using the gaHealth corpus demonstrated a maximum BLEU score improvement of 22.2 points (40%) when compared with top performing models from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task.

The following training files may be used for developing in-domain health models:

gaHealth.en.txt
gaHealth.ga.txt

The following files have augmented the gaHealth corpus with 8k lines of additional data from LoResMT2021:

gaHealth*.en.txt
<br /> gaHealth*.ga.txt

In order to test the accuracy of in-domain health models developed using gaHealth, the validation and test sets from LoResMT2021 were used:

-- dev.en
-- dev.ga

-- test.en.txt
-- test.ga.txt
