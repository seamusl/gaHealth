Foreword by the Minister
This Strategy is published at a defining moment for Ireland.
Confronted with unprecedented challenges in the form of a pandemic, the Department of Health, the HSE and all partners in the health sector, the Government more broadly and the Irish public have all risen to meet the challenge.
We will continue to lead the COVID-19 public health response and to support the resilience and future preparedness of health and social care services. We will also build on the innovation, agility and transformation displayed in the response to date to the Covid-19 emergency and will continue to advance the Sláintecare vision.
The Government sets out an ambitious agenda in the Programme for Government and is making progress to deliver this through an unprecedented investment in health and social care services.
This investment will meet specific demands of the Covid-19 response, the broader care needs of the Irish public, and importantly will fund the ambitious Sláintecare transformation agenda.
This reform programme, benefiting from such strong political consensus, will help to ensure sustainable health and social care in Ireland.
I am intent on advancing towards universal healthcare in the years ahead.
Through all of our efforts in the health and social care sector, we will ensure that the public and service users see concrete, tangible improvements in their access to services, their experiences and their outcomes.
The public and service users will be engaged at the heart of the work that we do.
Strengthening the strategic capabilities of the Department and sharpening its strategic focus will help to ensure that we deliver across the ambitious health agenda set out in the Programme for Government, which includes:
Delivery of Care in a COVID-19 Environment Implementing Sláintecare
Promoting Women’s Health
A Healthier Future
Mental Health
A Health-led Approach to Drugs Misuse An Age-friendly Ireland
Disability
Climate Action.
I look forward to working with Ministers of State Rabbitte, Butler and Feighan, colleagues in the Department and partners in the wider health and social care sector as we improve Irish health and social care over the coming three years.
Introduction by the Secretary General
Since the onset in February 2020 of COVID-19, colleagues in the Department of Health have shown what public service means.
The organisational values described in this Statement of Strategy are lived and on display every day in Miesian Plaza and with those working from home – leadership, professionalism, integrity, accountability, innovation.
Most of all there is a shared, deep and abiding commitment to serving and delivering for the public and to supporting the Minister, Ministers of State and the Government.
This Statement of Strategy was prepared in consultation with the public, our stakeholders, our agencies, other Government departments and staff at the Department of Health.
The Strategy responds to the commitments set out in the Programme for Government and is informed by an environmental analysis, which will also influence how we go about delivering our Strategy.
The Statement of Strategy identifies a clear and select set of strategic priorities for the Department, aligned with the Programme for Government priorities and the Sláintecare long-term vision for health and social care.
Over the coming three years, we will build on our work of recent years and deliver on the vision of universal healthcare set out in Sláintecare.
We are guided by the three pillars of the Health Service Capacity Review 2018: promoting healthier lives and preventing illness (and continuing in the near term with public health protection); expanding integrated care in the community; and reforming acute hospital care.
Advancing these priorities will involve strengthening our capabilities as a Department to deliver on our core functions, as we become an organisation fit for the future, with enhanced oversight capacity, and enhanced capacity to manage risk and engage in continuous learning.
The exercise of developing and implementing this Strategy is thus an exercise in becoming a more strategic Department; a more capable Department; and a more open Department, engaging with our partners and stakeholders to listen and to encourage alignment.
The Department will also need to be the right size to continue to deliver its mandate effectively.
The response to COVID-19 has demonstrated the Department’s strong leadership of the health and social care sector, and how effectively we can collaborate across government.
We intend to continue to play a leading role in advancing important cross-government work, including on the COVID-19 public health response, the Healthy Ireland agenda to address the wider determinants of health, mental health policy, climate action, and equality and human rights.
Our mandate and our work in the Department of Health is broad, varied and profoundly important.
Over the past year the Department’s work has been more in the spotlight than ever before.
I am proud of the work colleagues in the Department have done in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
I would like to thank colleagues in the Department and across the health and social care system for your diligence and commitment.
Together we can look forward to implementing this Strategy to make a real difference to the public and to service users throughout Ireland.
Scope, Purpose and Use of our Statement of Strategy
About the document
This Statement of Strategy sets out the direction for the Department of Health’s work for the next three years.
The development of the Strategy has taken into account the wider context within which the Department of Health operates and is mindful of the important role played by the various partners and stakeholders that contribute towards our shared vision.
Informed by our current environment, this Strategy focuses on our specific role and distinct contribution to improving the health and wellbeing of the people of Ireland and our role in ensuring that health and social care services are delivered to those who need them.
Further details about the process used to develop this Statement of Strategy are available in Appendix I.
The scope of the statement of strategy This is a Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health; it does not seek to set out a strategy for the entire health sector.
It is the Department’s corporate strategy for the next three years.
It focuses on the breadth of work that the Department delivers, within its role and function.
All of the work of the Department of Health is carried out in service of our vision, mission and commitment to the people of Ireland.
All of the broader work of the Department of Health is represented in our published strategies, policies and is detailed through our annual business planning process.
It aligns with the commitments set out in the Programme for Government and the Sláintecare fundamental principles (figure 1).
In the context of this work, there are five strategic priorities that will provide a focus to advance our mission in the next three years.
This Strategy is written in a time of high uncertainty; therefore it is a living document which will be reviewed regularly during the period 2021-2023 to ensure it continues to be useful in directing our work and responding to changes in the environment.
Components of the strategy
The Strategy outlines our: vision: the Department’s long-term vision for the health and wellbeing of all the people of Ireland; mission: our purpose as a Department and the contribution we seek to make; strategic priorities: priority areas that the Department will focus on for 2021-2023; initiatives: the initiatives likely to have the most impact in advancing the strategic priorities over the next three years; enablers: the supports that will make it possible to implement this strategy; values: the deeply ingrained principles that guide all our actions; and performance: metrics that will be used to assess our success in fulfilling our Strategy.
The breadth of our work
The Department of Health has more than 600 employees working together across multiple units and divisions to deliver on a very broad mission and mandate.
Further information about who we are is available online at: www.gov.ie/health and https:// whodoeswhat.gov.ie/root/health/
The function of the Department of Health is to serve the public and support the Minister for Health, Ministers of State, and the Government: by providing leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes; by undertaking governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high-quality services; by collaborating to achieve health priorities and contribute to wider social and economic goals; and by creating an organisational environment where high performance is achieved, collaborative working is valued, and the knowledge and skills of staff are developed.
The Department adheres to the Corporate Governance Standard for the Civil Service.
The Department’s Corporate Governance framework focuses on its legal, regulatory, policy and service obligations and on the sets of relationships between the Minister, Ministers of State, Secretary General, the Management Board, senior management, all staff and stakeholders in determining the direction and performance of the organisation.
More information is available: gov.ie/health The Department undertakes a broad range of work in accordance with our functions.
We are a relatively small Department with significant responsibility and accountability for the expenditure of one of the consistently largest budgets among government departments.
Our work encompasses: leadership of the delivery of the COVID-19 response; policy development and driving reform based on the vision and principles laid out in Sláintecare.
This includes policy development and reform across: public health, health and wellbeing, primary and community care, social care, mental health, women’s health, acute hospital services, eligibility, and e-health and health information; governance and oversight of bodies under our aegis including the Health Service Executive; responsibility for regulatory policy, including the regulation of certain health professionals, service providers, private health insurance, medicines; leadership in patient safety policy and legislation through the National Patient Safety Office; professional leadership through our Chief Medical Officer and Chief Nursing Officer; strategic workforce planning and development and managing industrial relations at national level; investment in capital infrastructure; ensuring accountability, including through the management of a significant volume of parliamentary work, public correspondence, and media queries; delivery of a significant programme of legislation;
providing support for the Department’s core functions through expertise in finance, legal, HR, data protection, research, statistics and analytics, policy development, audit, programme management, bioethics; and delivery of civil service, cross-governmental and international commitments.
There are 19 bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health, including one commercial State body.
These are listed in Appendix IV.
The largest of our agencies is the Health Service Executive which is responsible for providing public health and social care services to everyone in Ireland.
More information on the HSE, including its corporate plan, is available at https://www.hse.ie/eng/ These bodies and agencies, together with a wide range of other stakeholders, fulfil their roles in delivering health and social care services to the people of Ireland.
This statement of strategy will guide our work
This Strategy is informed by the Programme for Government, the Sláintecare report and fundamental principles, extensive consultation and the current multifaceted environment.
The Department of Health operates within a complex system of determinants of health and wellbeing, working alongside, and in partnership with, a wide range of service providers and stakeholders and other Government Departments to deliver our mission.
Our environment is increasingly complex and rapidly changing.
As we have seen with the COVID-19 pandemic and response, it can present sudden threats requiring rapid diversion of attention and resources. This Statement of Strategy has been compiled amid much uncertainty.
An analysis of our external environment has informed the approach of this Strategy and its five strategic priorities, and will inform how we advance and deliver this Strategy.
Within the next three years it is clear that the Department will need to be agile, building our capacity to plan for uncertainty, be strategic and remain responsive to our environment.
The Statement of Strategy is owned by all of the staff of the Department of Health and will be used to guide our work.
It is the framework we will use over the next three years to strengthen our strategic focus as a Department and to measure our progress.
It will also be used as the foundation for guiding our engagement with our agencies, partners and stakeholders.
Specific processes will be put in place to ensure the delivery of the Strategy and these are outlined in the following sections.
Strategic Priorities
Over the next three years, the Department of Health will continue to deliver across the broad portfolio of our work to fulfil our core functions.
In the context of our wider work, a number of strategic priorities have been selected to bring focus to our collective work over the next three years and enable us to measure our success.
The Department’s Strategic Priorities for the period 2021-2023 are:
1. Manage COVID-19 and promote public health.
2. Expand and integrate care in the community.
3. Make access to healthcare fairer & faster.
4. Improve oversight and partnership in the sector.
5. Become an organisation fit for the future.
These priorities fulfil the following criteria: They will deliver on commitments made in the Programme for Government.
They will progress Sláintecare reforms.
They are necessary in the context of COVID-19.
They are priorities that the Department of Health, in its unique role, must respond to or lead on.
The first three priorities focus on policy and reform and are essential for the delivery of Sláintecare.
These priorities incorporate the initiatives within the Sláintecare Strategic Action Plan 2021 -2023 around improving timely access to care and addressing health inequalities.
The fourth and fifth priorities focus on strengthening the Department’s core functions to ensure we deliver on our role.
All five priorities are important in their own right but they are also interlinked.
Progressing these priorities will require significant work, allocation of resources and collaborative working across the Department of Health.
The five strategic priorities are elaborated below including key initiatives and measures of success.
Strategic Priority 1
Manage COVID-19 and promote public health
What does this strategic priority mean?
Leading the public health response to COVID-19 and future preparedness for health protection.
Investing in, and developing, population health planning, prevention of illness and promotion of health and wellbeing.
Why this is a priority
The Department will continue to play a leading role in Ireland’s response to the Pandemic. The Programme for Government prioritises the protection public health, patients and to ensuring sufficient health service capacity.
Focus is likely to shift within the timeframe of this strategy. However, even after the immediate impact of the pandemic has passed, the longer term impacts of COVID-19 on health will require attention.
Given current trends and the projections for Ireland’s future demands for healthcare, the capacity of the health and social care service is not sustainable unless real progress is made in preventing illness and supporting people to live healthier lives including through implementation of the cross-Government Healthy Ireland Framework.
The key initiatives for the Department that could have most impact in the next three years are
Performance Metrics – How will we know that we have advanced this strategic priority?

Strategic Priority 2
Expand and integrate care in the community
What does this strategic priority mean?
Keeping people well at home, or near home, by expanding and increasing primary care and social care available in the community, within an integrated model of care across all settings.
Why this is a priority
The Programme for Government makes strong commitments to strengthen community-based care, including primary care and social care, and sees this as fundamental to advancing Sláintecare reforms.
Care in the community will be expanded in a way that integrates care across all relevant settings.
Enhanced integration will reduce the system’s dependency on acute hospital care through early and timely patient engagement with the primary and community care systems.
This will make it easier for people to access the care they need in a timely way, and will build on innovations that arose during the COVID-19 response.
The key initiatives for the Department that could have most impact in the next three years are
Progress expanded and integrated community care.

What does this strategic priority mean?
Health and social care based on need and not on ability to pay.
A whole-of-system approach to support better health outcomes through the right care delivered in the right place at the right time, importantly addressing fundamental health inequalities.
Why this is a priority
The Programme for Government commits to providing fairer and more affordable care, promoting women’s health and a range of initiatives targeting marginalized groups to ensure our services meet everyone’s needs.
Improving timely access to care and addressing health inequalities are two key Sláintecare Reform Programmes.

How the Department will implement and monitor the Strategy
The Department will implement the Statement of Strategy through: specific implementation processes for the Statement of Strategy put in place, including clear ownership within the Department; staff engagement; organisational leadership and governance structures put in place; internal alignment with other strategic processes and with our business planning process; allocation of resources to support the delivery of the strategic priorities; external collaboration and alignment with agencies and partners; and monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning mechanisms put in place.
We will measure our success by tracking: high level performance metrics relating to the five strategic priorities, as outlined above; the delivery of our strategic initiatives; and the establishment and functioning of the processes and structures put in place to deliver the strategy.
These metrics will assist us in measuring our success as we move through the next three-year cycle.
We will also deliver an annual report against this Statement of Strategy and an annual learning exercise and refresh of the Strategy to ensure this is a living document that remains responsive to our environment.
The environmental analysis completed during the development of this Strategy presented a range of opportunities to strengthen our contribution.
Our evolving internal and external environmental contexts will also guide and shape how the Strategy is delivered.
Developing our Internal Environment
This is the corporate strategy for the Department of Health over the next three years, and as such it contains a strong focus on attending to our internal environment and strengthening the Department.
This focus on strengthening our organisation is highlighted in strategic priorities 4 and 5 and is captured in our values and the key enablers outlined below, which will provide the supports that will make it possible for the Department to achieve its strategic priorities.
This focus on our organisation is necessary in order to deliver our Strategy and advance our mission.
The values of the Department will guide all of our work over the next three years.
They are the deeply ingrained principles that serve as our cultural cornerstones.
A dedication to putting the people of Ireland and users of our health and social care services at the centre of all our work, engaging them in the work that we do Key enablers
1. Empowered teams and collaborative working
In line with the Public Sector Duty and Our Public Service 2020, we are committed to a culture of respect, collaboration and innovation, where staff feel empowered in their roles and supported in the pursuit of a healthy work/life balance.
As the complexity of our work has increased, the need to collaborate both internally and externally to tackle some of society’s biggest challenges is even greater.
We will learn from and leverage best practice to strengthen our adaptability and capability through innovative, collaborative policy-making and new ways of working together.
2. Organisational structures and resources Our capacity to deliver on our functions, and the work that is required of us, depends on adequate resourcing and organisation.
Significant internal reorganisation has taken place to ensure the delivery of immediate priorities, including the COVID-19 response, but we must also be well-equipped for the delivery of reform and our longer-term priorities.
It is essential that our organisational structure and design, and our staff complement, are fit for purpose.
We will enhance our remote working capability and work towards the Programme for Government mandate for public sector employers to move to 20% home and remote working in 2021. A strong commitment to respect and the fair and equal treatment of all
An open culture that encourages collaboration, innovation, and forward thinking
A deep-rooted ethos of integrity, impartiality, and value for money.
3. Data, technology and digitisation Advancement in health systems information, and innovations in technology and digitisation, are vital in underpinning an evidence-based approach to policy making that is person-centred and delivers on strategic priorities.
Data is also of crucial importance to government for supporting decision-making, shaping policy and facilitating the effective delivery of public services.
We will finalise and deliver on the Health Information System Strategy and additional investments in our infrastructure to ensure that we are equipped to do our work.
4. Innovation
As an organisation, we are committed to embracing innovation in line with Making Innovation Real, the Public Service Innovation Strategy (2020), and Our Public Service 2030.
The COVID-19 pandemic response sparked innovation across the health system, including in the Department of Health, and the insights and lessons learned from this will be identified and built upon.
There is also broader potential for further collaboration between the health service and the enterprise sector.
We will develop an Innovation Strategy as a key enabler for the actions described in this Statement of Strategy, and will embrace innovative methods of working across our policy development and research functions in particular.
5. Stakeholder collaboration and alignment We are part of the wider civil service and work alongside other Government Departments to serve the people of Ireland.
We work closely with other Departments to deliver the Programme for Government and play a leadership role in the implementation of specific governmental priorities including, in particular, the Healthy Ireland Framework and the public health response to COVID-19.
We will continue working in cooperation with other government departments on the wider determinants of health in order to prevent illness, and on the proposed development of wellbeing indicators.
We are committed to playing our part in the delivery of key cross-governmental initiatives, including climate action and ensuring equality.
The Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) are working closely to ensure a smooth transfer of
responsibility for specialist disability services to DCEDIY, while the Department of Health will continue to oversee any residual functions relating to access to health services that are retained.
The Department will continue to support the obligations in the Disability Act 2005 to include people with disabilities in mainstream services.
Further, and in line with HSE guidance, general health and social care teams will work to deliver services that are accessible to all people with disabilities.
Within the health sector, we are committed to ongoing engagement and communication with stakeholders in all aspects of our work.
As part of our mission to create a more responsive, integrated and person-centred health and social care service, we are dependent on sustained engagement to understand and deliver on the needs of the Irish public.
We are committed to working for and in partnership with the public in all we do, through collaborative policy-making, and by engaging local communities, health and social care providers (including voluntary providers) and other stakeholders through key programmes including Sláintecare, Healthy Ireland and the Women’s Health Taskforce.
As we have seen during the COVID-19 emergency, if we are to make progress on key health and social care initiatives like Healthy Ireland or Sláintecare, the Department must represent a trusted and leading voice on health in Ireland.
By engaging consistently with service users, the public, and providers and staff across the health and social care system, we will work together to deliver on our collective vision for the future.
Coherence and alignment with our agencies, partners and other key stakeholders is essential to advance the strategic priorities set out in this Strategy 2021-23.
Responding to our External Environment
An analysis of our external environment has informed the development of this Statement of Strategy.
The current environment presents the Department of Health with a range of opportunities to strengthen our contribution and this Statement of Strategy provides our framework for responding.
The Department will continue to take a leading role in Ireland’s response to the pandemic, working alongside the HSE, and the broad spectrum of health and social care providers, other Government Departments and with the people of Ireland.
Nobody is unaffected by the pandemic and the consequences on our people’s health and wellbeing are not yet fully known.
Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and its wider impact on health and service delivery will continue to be the Department’s top priority for as long as is necessary.
2. Political Landscape
The Programme for Government provides the Government’s priorities and commitments.
Those commitments relevant to the Department of Health are listed in Appendix II.
Sláintecare was drawn up with cross-party political support, representing a unique platform and opportunity for collaboration towards the transformation of our health and social care services.
The Programme for Government reiterates the Government’s commitment to Sláintecare and this Statement of Strategy outlines the Department’s role in leading on the Sláintecare programme of reform.
3. Changing Demographics
Ireland’s shifting demographic profile contributes to the need for reform of the health system as reported in the Department of Health’s Health Service Capacity Review 2018.
The Capacity Review indicated a need for significant expansion in the capacity of the health service, as well as substantial reform in how services are delivered.
Sláintecare represents the framework for these reforms.
Our first three strategic priorities represent our commitment to the necessary policy development and reform to meet the future needs of our population.
4. Economic Outlook
Resource pressures can be anticipated as a feature of the health and social care landscape over this strategic period 2021-23, particularly in the context of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and of Brexit.
The significant increase in investment in health and social care in Budget 2021 represents a real opportunity to deliver on national health and social care strategies and reform priorities.
Significant additional resources secured in Budget 2021 will drive and support the management of COVID-19 in tandem and as part of overall health service delivery and reform.
Strategic priority 4 outlines the initiatives we will take towards ensuring value for money in relation to this investment.
5. Public Engagement and Trust 6. Equality and Equity
The Department of Health serves the people of Ireland.
We are committed to engaging and involving patients and people in their own health and wellbeing, and care and treatment, as well as improving citizen participation in policy-making.
This is essential to achieving our vision.
The pandemic has transformed public knowledge and perception of the Department of Health.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the impact of Government decision-making and the important role that the civil service plays has become clearer than ever before for many.
With an unprecedented investment in health and social care services in 2021, the continuing threat of the pandemic, and advancements in technology and communications, public expectation is higher than ever.
Increased awareness of the role of the Department of Health, due to our role in the COVID-19 response, presents an opportunity to build on a high level of public engagement with health issues and to further strengthen our partnership with the Irish public.
The Public Sector Duty under Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 outlines the Department’s responsibility to eliminate discrimination, promote equality and protect human rights of staff and service users.
The Department of Health has specific responsibilities and this Statement of Strategy emphasises our commitments through strategic priority 3 and embedding equality as one of our core values.
In particular: The Department of Health will address health inequalities in line with the reform programme detailed in the Sláintecare Strategic Action Plan 2021 -2023.
The Department of Health will continue to promote compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the health (including mental health) and social care sphere.
The Department is demonstrating its commitment to the Public Sector Duty through specific commitments including: a committment to undertake a Public Sector Duty Self-Assessment; engaging with bodies under our aegis to ensure that they comply with the Public Sector Duty; implementing Department of Health actions within relevant National Strategies, listed in Appendix III, many of which cover services for marginalised groups; and reporting on progress towards our commitment to the Public Sector Duty in our annual report.
7. International Landscape
8. Climate Action
International trends and obligations shape our environment.
There is a strong international focus on progress in the areas of Universal Health Coverage, primary health care and non-communicable diseases, as well as pandemic preparedness and global health security.
Ireland’s Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 sets out the Government’s ambitious response to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and commits Ireland to fully achieving all 17 of the Goals by 2030.
This Department will continue to work with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and relevant partners in order to achieve the relevant SDG targets, with a focus on SDG3 Good Health and Wellbeing.
The UK’s exit from the EU will also continue to demand significant engagement, planning and agile management on the part of the Department, the HSE and other agencies.
Climate change represents a significant challenge to the health and social care system as we must confront both our contributions to emissions and waste production, and also the adverse health impacts threatened by air and water pollution and general environmental degradation.
These risks include rising levels of chronic disease, respiratory illness, and infectious disease, and the potential for more frequent pandemics.
As part of the Government’s vision for Universal Healthcare, the Programme for Government commits to the delivery of “sustainable care”, highlighting climate consciousness as key to achieving long-term health goals for Ireland.
The Department of Health has published its Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Health Sector 20192024.
The Department supports and aligns with cross-governmental initiatives including those laid out in the Climate Change Action Plan 2019, the Public Sector Mandate, the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill and the Decarbonisation Strategy forthcoming in 2021.
Our policy-making is informed by international thinking and best practice and we share both our data and our experience widely through both formal and informal international partnerships and networks.
The Department is committed to a continuing contribution to shape EU processes and outcomes as they affect the citizen.
The Department will continue to contribute internationally and to learn from international best practice, including through engagement and collaboration with other international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and others.
The Department is committed to strengthening our leadership role, our oversight function in the sector, and our cross government engagement on climate action.
Our commitment will be demonstrated in this strategic cycle through: appointment of dedicated staff on climate change; adherence to the forthcoming Public Sector Mandate and direction of bodies under our aegis to adopt a climate mandate; compliance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill; implementation of the Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Health Sector (2019-2024); continued implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2019 and contribution to, and implementation of, the Climate Action Plan 2021; examination of WHO recommendations and best practice approaches to reducing waste and improving ecological practice in health care; and commitment to actions in the forthcoming Decarbonisation Strategy and compliance with reporting measures applying across the Public Sector.
The Department of Health holds a unique role in a complex system.
Over the next three years, this Statement of Strategy will guide our work as we collaborate with colleagues across government, our agencies, the public and all stakeholders in the health and social care sector towards our shared vision of ‘a healthier Ireland, with improved health and wellbeing for all, and with the right care, delivered in the right place, at the right time’.
We will strengthen our organisation to develop and harness the capability of our staff, who are our most important asset.
We will remain responsive and adaptable to our national and international environment, learning from and sharing best practice.
Most importantly, we will work with and be accountable to the Irish public as we deliver on our strategic priorities, serving them in all the work that we do.

Analysis and Drafting
Analysing research findings and consultation feedback to draft Statement of Strategy
Overview
This Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health has been written in accordance with the Public Service Management Act of 1997.
The Act indicates that a Department is required to submit to the Minister of the Government a strategy statement in respect of the Department i) within 6 months after the appointment of a new Minister of the Government having charge of the Department or Scheduled Office, and ii) at the expiration of the 3 year period since the last such statement was prepared and submitted.
The formation of a new Government in July 2020, and the subsequent appointment of a new Minister for Health, thus necessitated the development of a Statement of Strategy for the Department.
A project team was convened in September 2020, to develop and submit a completed Strategy document to the Minister for Health by December 2020.
In that timeframe, the project team undertook a detailed process of strategic review, consultation, analysis and drafting as described below.
The process was designed to produce a Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health that articulates the mediumterm priorities of the organisation, providing strategic direction and clarity for the years 2021-2023.
A successful Statement of Strategy will be a touchstone for colleagues in developing and aligning their dayto-day work, while communicating to the public and a broad range of stakeholders the Department’s priorities for the coming period and how they fit into a long-term vision for health.
Strategic Review
The project team undertook an extensive strategic review in the initial phases of development for this Statement of Strategy.
The objectives of this strategic review were to: learn from previous Statements of Strategy (those belonging to the Department of Health, other government departments and private sector bodies); compile relevant information from strategic documents that will inform our priorities for the coming period e.g. Department of Health commitments to national strategies, relevant information related to the environmental context; gather important information related to the Department’s obligations as a public sector body e.g. obligations to climate action articulated in the Programme for Government and obligations to the IHREC Public Sector Duty; and inform consultation with key stakeholders.
Documents deemed relevant to the review met at least one of the following criteria: Include elements required to be included in the Statement of Strategy as referenced in the Guidelines Major Department of Health strategies, priorities and/or obligations Government and/or cross departmental strategies, priorities, risks, or issues
The project team reviewed a total of 89 documents in the initial review phase, across six types of document, summarised in the table below.
Specific attention was paid to key strategic documents including the Programme for Government and Sláintecare documents.
Total number of documents reviewed:
Number of Department of Health Reports and key strategies with links to the Programme for Government
Number of HSE/agency documents
Number of cross departmental documents
Number of international documents
Number of documents informed by citizen perspectives
Number of other Statements of Strategy reviewed
This review contributed to the Department’s understanding of its environmental context, the role of the organisation in leading the health and social care sector, the views of stakeholders and, ultimately, to the determination of strategic priorities.
Consultation
Consultation was core to the development of this Statement of Strategy.
It was important to engage with stakeholders internally and externally across the health and social care system to understand: how staff view the challenges and opportunities facing the Department, and gain their input on the priorities of the Department in the medium-term; how the Statement of Strategy might best provide strategic direction for staff; and how stakeholders outside the Department, including the public and the Department’s agencies, see the Department’s role and their views on what the Department should prioritise in its role in the medium term to deliver on the long-term vision for the health and social care system.
Over a 6-week period, the Department engaged in a detailed consultation process.
Internal consultation included engagement with:
Minister for Health, Ministers of State; Acting Secretary General and Management Board; a cross-divisional reference group, with three workshops held;
Management Board’s subcommittees on risk and policy; all-staff via internal survey; internal senior management networks via workshops; and colleagues expert in areas related to strategic priorities via workshops.
Analysis and Drafting
The analysis and drafting stage of developing this Statement of Strategy was an iterative process.
Gathering the information collected through the initial strategic review and consultation phases, the project team produced analyses of internal and external factors that could affect the progression of strategic priorities.
This analysis accounted for internal strengths and weaknesses as well as external factors such as the political context, advances in technology, and economic trends.
Situating the results of extensive consultation in these contexts, the project team produced multiple drafts of this strategic document, which were tested in various iterations with stakeholders including internal subject matter experts and presented to senior management for review.
External consultation included: a inter-departmental group working on Statements of Strategy was convened by the Department of Health and held 2 meetings including inputs on the Public Sector Duty from IHREC and on climate action from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications; invitation of submissions from other government departments; public consultation via online survey which received 2555 responses; consultation with the HSE and aegis bodies – 14 submissions received; and
In December 2020, the Department project team for the Statement of Strategy submitted a draft to the Acting Secretary General for approval.
It was then submitted to the Minister for final approval ahead of submission to the Oireachtas, in line with the requirements of the Public Service Management Act 1997.
Ahead of publication, the Statement of Strategy was translated into Irish as per the requirements of the Official Languages Act 2003.
The Strategy and supporting documents were published on the Department of Health’s website.
additional consultation with external experts on risk and strategy.
These consultations formed a vital part of the development process for this Statement of Strategy, ensuring that it reflects a shared vision for the future of the health and social care service.

HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
The last 12 months have seen progressive change in a number of areas across the HSE, from service developments which are enhancing the experience of patients, to new ways of working which are changing the way services are delivered.
During the year, Ireland: Country Health Profile 2019, State of Health in the EU reported Ireland as having the fastest improving life expectancy in the EU driven by survival rates from conditions such as heart disease, stroke and cancer.
The same report stated that Ireland has the highest share of the population that reports being in good health in the EU.
These are important measures of general population health and mean that with its partners the HSE is achieving success in helping people to maintain good health and access effective healthcare services when illness arises.
Progress also continues with the reform and modernisation of services including work on the introduction of major trauma centres and trauma units, further development of clinical networks for specialist services, and the introduction of new community-based care delivery models.
As Chairperson of the Board, I and my colleagues on the Board are pleased to submit the first Annual Report and Financial Statements prepared since the re-establishment of a Board for the Health Service Executive (HSE) in June 2019.
As we submit this Annual Report and Financial Statements, COVID-19 has changed the focus of all healthcare systems around the world, including our own.
The scale of the current challenge facing the Irish health system from COVID-19 and the associated HSE response is unprecedented.
Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and everyone working within the HSE have redirected their focus and attention to managing this pandemic to ensure that lives are saved and overall health is protected.
Colleagues are working hour-by-hour to continually support public health, hospitals, the community, nursing homes, the National Ambulance Service and other essential functions as we all strive to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
On behalf of the Board, I am extremely grateful for the dedication and extraordinary commitment of every member of staff for all that is being done during this unprecedented and difficult time.
That thanks extends to General Practitioners (GPs), pharmacists and other community based workers as well as to everyone working in our partner organisations and our stakeholders.
Healthcare workers, from the doctor or nurse in the front line to the procurement expert or tech support colleague, all have mobilised quickly to protect our country and our people from the virus.
They are to be admired and commended.
Recent increases in the HSE’s annual budget allocation have helped the HSE to make significant improvements in many areas and we are grateful for those increases.
As a Board we are pleased with the improved financial control within the HSE.
Financial control and predictability are a requirement for effective planning of operational capacity and future investment.
I again thank colleagues for helping us make rapid progress in this area, progress which will pay back in stakeholder confidence and will set us up well to open discussions on future funding through a long-term multi-year settlement.
Whilst these and many other improvements should be welcomed we know that we have much more to do.
The demand for health services is exceeding available capacity and unmet need is accumulating, often expressed in significant waiting lists in both hospitals and the community and through increased demand for emergency care.
The past year was also challenging for the health service as a result of issues which arose from the audit process in CervicalCheck and the publication of the MacCraith report into the delays in issuing cervical screening human papillomavirus (HPV) retest results to a large cohort of women and their GPs.
As a Board we are determined to increase service capacity to reduce waiting times.
We are equally determined to avoid failures in services we provide which cause distress to those who are supposed to benefit from them and to the staff who administer them.
Both groups deserve better.
Listening to what matters to our patients is fundamental in shaping the way we deliver services.
During 2019, a number of areas were progressed to promote patient and service user involvement across our health service in order to hear the views of stakeholders who have day-to-day experiences of the health services and to gain an understanding of what they see as the priorities for the future.
Service improvement is best achieved when the voice of the patient, the clinician and the service manager are simultaneously engaged in improving outcomes.
We hope to see further progress in this area though the current year.
As the Board, I and my colleagues are in a position of significant trust, privilege and responsibility in working with staff across the HSE in improving how the organisation is run, how it delivers services, and how it plans for the future provision of health and social care services.
I am very optimistic for the years ahead and we will collectively strive to provide the health service that our population deserves.
With an increasing population who are living longer, it is crucial that the health services effectively plan for future healthcare needs.
New ways of working and delivering services bring great opportunities and ensure that future healthcare in Ireland remains of the highest quality, with the patient placed at the heart of all we do.
As part of the response to COVID-19, a range of significant and essential changes has been put in place by the HSE and this provides an opportunity to identify changes which should be retained in the future.
Doing so will ensure that we capitalise on the gains that have been made during the crisis, minimising long-term impacts for patients and staff while maximising value for the taxpayer.
The implementation of the long-term policy direction set out in Sláintecare will continue to be a key focus for us in 2020 and beyond.
Finally, I would like to thank sincerely all the Board members who served during the year for their commitment and valued contribution.
I would also like to thank the Minister for Health, his officials, our Board Committees, and our CEO, Paul Reid, his management team and all colleagues.
We have had an eventful first year.
I look forward to continued collaboration and to working with the new Government in 2020.
The year ahead promises to be a year of change and challenge and we look forward to both.
Chairperson, Health Service Executive Board
Ireland has many attributes on which to build a world-leading health system.
In the Board’s first year, we have been hugely impressed by the skill, commitment and expertise of the clinicians, support staff and managers of the HSE.
This is also the case for the equally dedicated staff of our partner organisations with whom we share the challenges of providing high quality care under tight financial control.
As a Board we see significant strengths in these attributes which will drive a high performing health and social care service of which we can all be rightly proud.
Through innovation, service development, new ways of working and thinking we have seen much positive change and remain committed to further improving the health and experience of our patients.
Introduction from the Chief Executive Officer
Our workforce is committed, and most have a strong vocation to public healthcare and to the public service.
It is my privilege as CEO to publish the 2019 Annual Report and Financial Statements for the HSE.
While we have seen many challenges in 2019, we are at this moment in the throes of defending our population against the COVID-19 global pandemic.
Our services are facing unprecedented pressures which have necessitated the coming together of the whole of our health system; public, private and not-for-profit.
Every service, every worker, and indeed every person and household has stepped up to the plate to support the national effort.
Our health system has shown an agility and a resilience that many of us did not believe was possible.
As CEO I hope to support our staff to continue to give the best of themselves, to be proud of their efforts and to be working for the HSE, and to sustain the confidence of the public, which has been so very important in sustaining all of us this far.
At year end the budget is under control.
The financial implications of COVID-19 will also be immense.
I take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathies.
The key priority for the HSE during 2019 was to maximise the provision of safe services to the people we serve, and to finally get a grip on the health budget.
Chief Executive Officer
Priorities in 2019
The delivery of quality and safe services
Transitioning to a new model of integrated care
Strengthening the confidence and trust in the organisation.
Our changing population
There is increasing pressure placed on our services as a result of population growth, an increasing incidence of chronic diseases and an ageing population.
Life expectancy is above the EU average with women living to, on average, 84 years and men to 80.4 years.
The three most common chronic diseases in Ireland are cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.
Chronic disease increases with age.
The population in 2019 grew by an estimated 3.8% since the 2016 Census.
This was across all age groups with the most significant growth seen in the older age groups.
The number of people aged 65 years and over has increased by 35.2% since 2009 (considerably higher than the EU average of 16.5%).
It is projected that the number of those over 65 years will increase by a further 15% in 2021.
This continuing growth is due mainly to medical innovations, enhanced treatments and improved lifestyles.
There are many positive trends visible within the health service: life expectancy is increasing, mortality rates are declining and survival rates from conditions such as heart disease, stroke and cancer are improving.
The experience of patients receiving care is generally good, with 84% of patients having a good/very good inpatient experience as indicated by the National Patient Experience Survey.
Progress has also been made in recent years in improving hospital productivity and efficiency, increasing proportion of appropriate procedures carried out as day case, and improving day of surgery admission rates.
But there is still room for improvement, particularly in relation to the length of time patients are having to wait to access particular services.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report Ireland: Country Health Profile 2019 provides an overview of health and the health system in Ireland.
The OECD report highlighted that our health expenditure per capita is above the EU average; public health and healthcare in Ireland are comparatively effective; the use of both primary care and inpatient care is lower in Ireland than the EU average; Ireland has a lower number of doctors but a relatively high number of nurses;
Introduction from the Chief Executive Officer
During 2019, the new Board of the HSE came into operation under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019.
In conjunction with the Board I worked to ensure that the patient, service user and the public are at the core of our thinking and planning, that we value and support all healthcare staff, including those who work in not-for-profit, that we are structured in a way which supports frontline services, and that our financial and operational management is strengthened.
I set out three immediate priorities for the organisation:
long waiting times remain a substantial problem in Ireland;
eHealth solutions will be an important element in the future service delivery model;
more efficient use of hospital resources can be achieved;
budget management remains an issue at all healthcare levels;
far-reaching changes are required to make the Irish health system sustainable.
What is evident from the OECD Report is that we have no choice but to pursue ambitious reform plans in order to make the best use of current resources.
These areas are being addressed in our National Service Plan (NSP) for 2020 linked to Sláintecare.
Strengthening management capacity
In 2019, the former Directorate structure within the HSE was replaced with an Executive Management Team (EMT) in July which meets fortnightly.
A Senior Leadership Team, comprising the EMT, National Directors, Hospital Group CEOs and Chief Officers of Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) has also been established and this group meets every second month.
Prior to the establishment of the HSE Board, the Department of Health (DoH) exercised direct oversight over the HSE’s performance.
However, the establishment of the Board necessitated a reconsideration of how the HSE and the DoH engage with one another around performance and related matters.
With the direct involvement of the Performance and Delivery Committee of the Board, a new engagement model with the DoH has been agreed.
This model recognises the DoH’s role as vote holder and the accountability that comes with that responsibility, while at the same time recognising that the Board is now the HSE’s governing body.
Since coming into office, I have come to appreciate just how essential it is that the HSE’s corporate structure and its administration becomes more outward looking and that we fully commit ourselves to supporting the people who staff our hospitals and provide care in the community.
A ‘review of the centre’ is currently underway.
Its initial focus is on the current organisation, its functions, structures and ways of working.
This will inform the future design, ensuring design robustness and consideration of all components, as well as informing the impact assessment required for implementation.
Reform
I committed to working to make Sláintecare a reality and it has been a key focus of our service planning for 2020.
(We have deployed many of the Sláintecare principles in how we have organised our response to COVID-19).
I have engaged extensively with the DoH and with the Sláintecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO)
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Introduction from the Chief Executive Officer
Improving capacity and access. Supporting the early implementation of Sláintecare, a €20m Sláintecare Integration Fund was established in 2019 to test and scale how services can best be delivered.
I have been working closely with the SPIO to support, monitor and evaluate the range of HSE projects and supports that have received funding.
Operational Performance
The NSP 2019 set out priorities and actions for the organisation by service area, together with targets against key performance indicators and expected levels of activity for 2019.
It includes detailed financial and Human Resources (HR) data together with a schedule of intended capital projects for 2019.
The Service Plan was supported by detailed business plans and operational plans identifying named responsible people for its delivery.
The National Performance Oversight Group review performance against the NSP.
The NSP 2019 has over 125 priorities with 555 supporting actions across all areas of service delivery and enabling functions.
80% of those actions were on schedule to be delivered (26% completed; 54% on track to be completed to the timeline set out in the NSP), almost 20% delayed and 1% not progressed.
Updates on many priorities and actions are included in this Annual Report.
Those delayed or not progressed are mainly due to resourcing issues, capacity constraints, dependencies on external stakeholders or factors outside the direct control of the action owner.
These however impact on our ability to meet our key performance indicator targets or planned activity levels.
Included within the service delivery chapter of this Annual Report, is a high level overview on the key performance indicators and activity data in 2019 against 2018 across community healthcare and acute services.
The full suite of data is included in Appendix 3.
During the year Professor Brian MacCraith conducted an independent and rapid review of delays in issuing cervical screening human papillomavirus (HPV) retest results to a large cohort of women and their GPs.
Professor MacCraith was asked to examine the series of events within the CervicalCheck programme that occurred following the delays and this report was presented to me in August.
While much work and many improvements have taken place in the CervicalCheck service, it is unacceptable that women should have to wait so long for important information about their health.
The HSE accepted entirely the findings of the MacCraith Review and committed to a careful and expeditious implementation in full of each of the
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 recommendations.
Improving financial management
On my first day as CEO I committed myself to improving financial reporting and controls.
This continues to be a difficult message to deliver, especially when it is clear that many services are under pressure.
However, managing the balance between providing access to high quality care and remaining within budget, is a key aspect of the role of health managers.
During 2019, we continued our intensive focus on financial management and financial planning.
Senior managers across the organisation were actively engaged regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.
Financial management meetings chaired jointly by myself and the Chief Financial Officer, are now a regular feature of our performance management processes and take place on a monthly basis.
Senior budget holders give account of their financial performance against service plan objectives and give an informed view of predicted outturn by end of year.
A new Integrated Financial Management System is being progressed.
Myself and the EMT are working with the Board to ensure good governance, including rigorous and meaningful risk oversight, and assurance as to the appropriate use of public money.
Developing our Corporate Plan
We are developing a new vision for our health services which will support implementation of Sláintecare and address our key priorities and goals for the next number of years.
An extensive Engagement and Consultation Programme with almost 12,000 external and internal stakeholders has now been completed, the findings of which will inform how we plan and deliver our services over the coming years.
Notwithstanding the considerable work undertaken to date, it has not been possible to conclude the Corporate Plan process by the intended timeline of end of March 2020, given the need for staff at all levels, from across the organisation, to focus on preparations for and responses to the COVID-19 emergency.
The Corporate Plan will be finalised later in 2020.
Brexit
The United Kingdom (UK) left the EU on 31 January 2020 and has entered a transition period until 31 December 2020.
The HSE had already put a comprehensive package of measures in place in 2019 to mitigate against the risk of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.
These preparations are continuing into 2020 and we will continue to work with the DoH and partner agencies to prepare for the end of the transition period and the new deadline date of end-December 2020.
In conclusion, I would like to thank once again all staff working in the HSE, across community, hospital and national services.
I would also like to acknowledge the support and commitment of my colleagues on the EMT and Senior Leadership Team.
I would like to pay tribute to the Board and to the Chairperson, the Board Committees, to the Minister for Health and to those working within the DoH.
I am conscious that 2020 has and will yet prove to be an extremely difficult year; particularly for families who have lost loved ones due to COVID-19.
As CEO I am immensely proud of the innovation we have shown in response to the current crisis.
Many of the measures we have taken as individuals and as an organisation clearly have the potential to transform the HSE permanently, and for the better.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Our Corporate Plan
Under the Health Act 2004 (as amended), the HSE is required to submit a Corporate Plan every three years, specifying the key objectives of the HSE for the period concerned.
The last formal Corporate Plan developed was for the period 2015-2017.
In 2018, in anticipation of the publication of Sláintecare and its strategic implications, it was agreed with the DoH to extend the 2015-2017 Corporate Plan by refreshing it to incorporate additional developments arising in 2018.
Recognising the establishment of the new HSE Board and the appointment of a new CEO and other governance arrangements covered in legislation, another refresh was completed in 2019.
The development of a new Corporate Plan commenced in quarter three of 2019 under the guidance and direction of the HSE’s EMT, the Performance and Delivery Committee of the Board and the Board itself.
A Project Team was established and a detailed Project Plan and Consultation Plan were developed.
It is intended that the Corporate Plan will be published later in 2020.
It will have a five-year focus, be aligned with Sláintecare and will focus on providing a clear medium-term roadmap for staff, patients, service users and all stakeholders. Developing the Corporate Plan
A number of steps were taken to examine the evidence base, policy environment and views of key stakeholders in determining an initial set of corporate priorities for consultation.
Initial insight and information gathering tasks provided an analysis of the health service from many perspectives.
These tasks included:
1. Completion of four Rapid Reviews which focused on:
i. Corporate Plans of relevant and comparable international health systems
ii. Existing strategies of the Irish health system
iii. Existing data relating to the views of citizens, staff and the people who use our services
iv. Population health and wellbeing profile of people living in Ireland
2. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threat (SWOT) analysis
3. A Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal (PESTEL) analysis.
Our Consultation Process
A critical component of the process to develop the Corporate Plan is relevant and broad consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and interested parties ensuring the voices of as broad a range of stakeholders as possible are brought to bear on the content of the Corporate Plan.
This has been done through the following channels:
Face-to-Face Consultation Meetings: open and broad ranging meetings focused on individuals and groups with particular interest in the strategic priorities and goals of the HSE
Workshops: involving both internal and external stakeholders
Community Panel: a panel established by the HSE providing early stage feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the health service
Written Submissions: from key stakeholder organisations across all key sectors – unions, statutory, government, HSE funded agencies, community and voluntary groups and professional bodies
On-line Open Survey: targeting both the public and staff
Omnibus Survey: targeting a nationally representative sample of 1,000 people
Regional Listening Meetings: targeting regional staff, community-based/support groups and members of the public.
Outputs from the each of the consultations will be analysed and key findings identified for consideration by the HSE Board in the preparation of the Corporate Plan.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Our Population
The population in 2019 has grown by an estimated 3.8% since the 2016 Census.
The population is growing across all regions and age groups, with the most significant growth seen in the older age groups.
Assuming moderate changes in migration and fertility rates, the total population is projected to reach some 5.7m by 2039 with more than one in five people expected to be aged 65 years or over.
Notwithstanding this growth in the older population, in 2016 a quarter of our population are children aged 0-17 years, which is high by EU comparisons.
Ageing population
The greatest change in population structure over the last 10 years is the growth in both the proportion and the number of people aged 65 years and over.
The number of people aged 65 years and over has increased by 35.2% since 2009, which is considerably higher than the EU average of 16.5% over the same period.
It is projected that the number of people aged 65 years and over will increase by a further 23,200 (14.9%) by 2021.
Similarly, the number of adults aged 85 years and over will increase by some 3,600 (4.5%) by 2021.
This continuing growth is due mainly to medical innovations, enhanced treatments and improved lifestyles.
Birth rates
There were 61,200 births in 2019, 184 more births when compared with the same period in 2018.
Births and birth rate have reduced in recent years and are projected to continue to reduce in the next decade.
The fertility rate has continued to decrease (1.75% in 2018) and is now at its lowest in the last decade; however, Ireland still has the third highest fertility rate in the EU behind France and Sweden.
Our Population
Over 4.9m people live in Ireland (Central Statistics Office (CSO), 2019).
The population has increased by 64,500 from April 2018 to April 2019, following a similar increase in 2017/2018, and these are the largest annual increases since 2008.
Greatest gains in life expectancy achieved in older age groups, reflecting decreasing mortality rates from major diseases
Mortality rates declined over past decade – mortality rates from circulatory system diseases decreased by 25.1%, respiratory death rates by 10.5% and cancer death rates by 10%
Life expectancy and health of the population
Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by 3.1 years for males and by almost two years for females since 2007 and is now above the EU average with women living to, on average, 84 years and men to 80.4 years.
The greatest gains in life expectancy have been achieved in the older age groups reflecting decreasing mortality rates from major diseases.
However life expectancy is socially patterned and is lower among unskilled workers compared to professional workers.
Studies have shown that certain groups have lower life expectancy such as Travellers and people who are homeless.
Suicide rates have fallen by 37.8% between 2009 and 2018 – However both self-harm presentations to hospital and suicide in the 15-19 age range are both above European norms
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Overall, age-standardised mortality rates have declined over the past decade; mortality rates from circulatory system diseases decreased by 25.1% between 2009 and 2018 and respiratory death rates and cancer death rates have decreased by 10.5% and 10% respectively over the same period.
Transport accident mortality rates have also fallen by 49.7% in the past decade.
Suicide rates have fallen by 37.8% between 2009 and 2018 and the rate in 2016 was 8.5 per 100,000, placing Ireland below the EU average for both men and women.
However, both self-harm presentations to hospital and suicide in the 15-19 age cohort are above European norms.
The infant mortality rate in 2019 was 3.3 per 1,000 live births and remains low by EU comparisons.
The average maternal age for all births registered in 2019 was 31.3 years, with teenage births reducing to 980 births in 2018 from 1,041 births in 2017 and 1,098 in 2016.
In recent years age-adjusted cancer incidence in Ireland is slowly declining for males and is stable for women – however the absolute number of cancer diagnoses is expected to approximately double to 43,000 by 2045 due to population growth and ageing
Lifestyle risk factors
In 2019, 14% of adults in Ireland smoked tobacco every day, down from 27% in 2002, and now slightly below the EU average.
Nearly one third of adults reported regular heavy alcohol intake in 2014, a rate well above the EU average.
The obesity rate increased to 18% in 2015, up from 15% in 2007, and is now higher than the EU average.
Chronic disease
The three most common chronic diseases in Ireland are cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.
These diseases give rise to three quarters of deaths in Ireland.
It is estimated that over 1.07m people over the age of 18 years currently have one or more chronic diseases.
As chronic disease increases with age, the highest prevalence is observed in the population aged 50 years and over.
The number of people in this age cohort, living with one or more chronic disease, is estimated to increase by 40% from 2016 levels, to 1.1m in 2030.
In recent years age-adjusted cancer incidence in Ireland is slowly declining for males and is stable for women.
Given population growth and ageing, if future populations have the same risk of being diagnosed with cancer as currently, the number of cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) would be expected to more than double in men and to almost double in women by 2045 (to 43,000 cases in total).
The burden of dementia is also projected to increase, from some 55,000 people in 2016 to over 150,000 people in 2046, almost a three-fold increase (The Irish National Dementia Strategy 2014).
The most common newly diagnosed cancers in Ireland for the years 2013-2015 were for men: prostate, colorectal and lung and for women: breast, lung and colorectal.
The next most common new cancer for both genders is melanoma
Ethnic and minority groups within our population include Travellers (30,987, CSO, 2016), asylum seekers (5,660 pending applications, Irish Refugee Council, 2018) and those who are homeless (6,696 adults and 3,752 children, Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, November 2019).
The estimated Roma population is between 4,000 and 5,000.
Marginalised groups Socially excluded groups have complex health needs and experience very poor health outcomes across a range of indicators such as chronic disease, morbidity, mortality and self-reported health.
These populations require greater support across a range of healthcare areas.
These statistics and trends provide us with an understanding of the demographic change and the challenges we face which have implications for future planning and health service delivery.
The burden of dementia is projected to increase from some 55,000 people in 2016 to over 150,000 people in 2046, almost a three-fold increase
This Annual Report describes what was accomplished in 2019 to meet the priorities set out in our National Service Plan 2019.
In meeting our legislative requirements under the Health Act 2004 (as amended), this Annual Report also reports progress against our Capital Plans and provides detailed financial statements for the organisation.
Governance
This is the first Annual Report prepared by the HSE since the re-establishment of a non-executive external Board for the organisation under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 which commenced on 28 June 2019.
During the period 1 January to 27 June the HSE Directorate was the governing body of the HSE under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, with the Director General accountable to the Minister for Health.
Since 28 June, the Board is the governing body of the HSE and is accountable to the Minister for Health for the performance of its functions.
The CEO is in turn accountable to and reports to the Board and is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE.
The HSE exercises a wide range of statutory functions which may have significant implications both for individuals and for the public generally.
Under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act of 2019, the Minister for Health can issue directions to the HSE on the implementation of Ministerial and government policies and objectives, and determine priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its Service Plan.
The HSE must comply with directions issued by the Minister for Health.
In line with the implementation of the recommendations of Sláintecare with regard to governance, the establishment of an independent Board was an important step in modernising and strengthening governance arrangements and sustaining reform.

In accordance with the Health Act 2004 (as amended) the Board has the following key functions:
1. It is the governing body of the Executive with authority, in the name of the Executive, to perform the functions of the Executive.
(a) performance of its functions
(b) achieving its objectives in accordance with the corporate plan
(iii) to enable compliance with the policies (whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents, or any combination thereof) of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that those policies may affect or relate to the functions of the Executive.
3. It is required to establish and implement arrangements for the management of the performance of the CEO.
The Board is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions above and shall inform the Minister in writing of any matter that it considers requires the Minister’s attention.
Under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2016), the Board is collectively responsible for leading and directing HSE activities within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed.
The Board is required to act on a fully informed and ethical basis, in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interest of the State body, having due regard to its legal responsibilities and the objectives set by Government.
The legislation recognises that neither the Board nor the CEO could exercise all of these functions personally and provides for a formal system of delegation under sections 16C and 16H of the Health Act 2004 (as amended).
This Delegations Policy Framework sets out the framework and supporting policy guidelines that underpin good governance regarding the system of delegation of statutory functions throughout the HSE.
This allows these functions to be undertaken on an operational basis through the Executive Management Team and Senior Leadership Team and their supporting structures within the organisation.
Committees
The Board has established four Committees in order to provide it with assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its functions.
Three of the Board’s Committees act in an advisory capacity and have no executive function.
The Audit and Risk Committee has a number of specific functions, and those pertaining to audit have a legislative basis.
The Board’s Committees are:
Audit and Risk Committee
People and Culture Committee
Performance and Delivery Committee
Safety and Quality Committee.
Functions of the Committees
The Audit and Risk Committee is established and maintained in accordance with section 40H of the Health Act 2004 (as amended) by section 23 of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019.
The legislation recognises that the Audit Committee has a role to provide oversight and advice on risk management.
Therefore, its title has been expanded to the ‘Audit and Risk Committee’ to reflect the full nature of its remit.
Legislation obliges membership of the Committee to comprise no fewer than three Board members and not fewer than four other persons who, in the opinion of the Board, have the relevant skills and experience to perform the functions of the committee, at least one of whom shall hold a professional qualification in accountancy or auditing.
Under current legislation the Committee is required to:
Advise the Board and the CEO on financial matters relating to its function
The functions of the Audit and Risk Committee include a range of financial, statutory, compliance and governance matters as set out in legislation.
People and Culture Committee
The role of the People and Culture Committee is to enhance the environment that supports and values the staff of the health service in order to engage the talent and nurture the leadership capability of individuals and teams working together to drive the desired culture throughout the health service to deliver safer better healthcare.
In pursuit of its role, the Committee will provide strategic oversight of and advice on matters to support the ambition of the People Strategy 2019-2024 to have the right people, with the right skills, in the right place and at the right time.
The Committee is not responsible for any executive functions and is not vested with any executive powers.
In relation to its duties and functions, it fulfils an advisory and support role only.
Governance and Our Organisation
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 provides for the establishment of an Audit Committee and any other Committees that the Board deem as necessary for the purpose of providing assistance and advice in relation to the performance of the Board’s functions. Safety and Quality Committee
The scope of the Committee’s authority extends to all aspects of safety and quality within the public health service.
The Committee is not responsible for any executive functions and is not vested with any executive powers.
In relation to its duties and functions, it fulfils an advisory and support role only. The Chairperson of the National Independent Review Panel reports to the Committee Chairperson.
Under the Health Act 2004 (as amended), the HSE is required to develop a Code of Governance to set out the principles and practices associated with good governance.
The current Code was issued in 2015 and during the year work commenced on a revised Code of Governance to be finalised in 2020.
The Statement on Internal Control in Part II Financial Governance of this Annual Report reflects our compliance with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2016).
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 strengthens independent oversight and performance of the HSE.
The establishment of the Board is an important step in improving governance arrangements and is a priority in the implementation of Sláintecare.
The Chairperson and the Board are working closely with the CEO and EMT to ensure the organisation works effectively as well as responding efficiently and productively to a range of new governance requirements stemming from these new arrangements.

Risk Management
Delivering quality and safe services for patients, service users and the public, is our overriding priority.
Real and meaningful partnerships between patients and those working at all levels of the health service generate a shared vision for a compassionate health service, one that learns when things go wrong, responds accordingly and reduces harm to those who entrust their lives and care to us.
Risks to the delivery of healthcare will ultimately impact on patients and those who use our services and it is this that guides our overall approach to the management of risk described below.
1. Risk Management in the HSE
The HSE is the largest public sector organisation in Ireland accounting for approximately one-third of all public expenditure, employing one-third of the public sector workforce and with one-third of the population accessing its services each year.
Effective risk management is an essential element of good corporate governance as it assists in determining priorities and setting objectives, analysing uncertainties within decision-making arrangements, clarifying accountabilities and demonstrating that the public interest is best served.
It is the policy of the HSE to manage risk on an integrated basis.
This means it is inclusive of all risk whether to do with management or service delivery processes.
It involves anticipating risks that threaten the achievement of objectives and putting in place actions that, as far as possible, reduce risks to an acceptable level.
2. Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities
Governance and Our Organisation
The Board has collective responsibility for leading and directing the HSE’s activities including the oversight of the Integrated Risk Management Policy, the approval of the risk management framework and monitoring of its effectiveness.
Audit and Risk Committee and other Committees of the Board
The Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board provides overall oversight and advice on the operation of the HSE’s Risk Management Policy and related activities within the function of risk management.
The Audit and Risk Committee works closely with other Board Committees in fulfilling this oversight function.
Executive Responsibilities
Whereas every staff member is responsible for identifying, notifying and managing risk within the context of their work, risk management is a line management responsibility.
The HSE’s Integrated Risk Management Policy outlines the roles and responsibilities for managing risk.
The Policy and its associated processes apply throughout the HSE and HSE-funded agencies.
The Policy requires each national team to clearly outline the governance arrangements for risk management, including the process for the notification of risk and the escalation of actions to the next level in the accountability structure.
National community and acute operations teams have arrangements in place to oversee how risk is managed and monitored across CHOs, Hospital Groups, and in the National Ambulance Service.
Other national functions have arrangements in place to oversee how risk is managed and monitored within their areas of responsibility (e.g.
Chief Financial Officer, National Human Resources, Chief Information Officer, Health Business Services (HBS), Internal Audit, National Screening Service, etc).
For HSE funded services, requirements for managing and monitoring risk are set out in the relevant service agreements between the HSE and individual agencies. 3. Review of Organisational Approach to Risk Management
Changes in 2019 to the HSE’s organisational structure at a corporate level together with the appointment of the HSE Board were key drivers in relation to the decision by the HSE to conduct a review of risk management.
This decision also coincided with the publication of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme 2018 which recommended that ‘the implementation of new governance arrangements for the HSE should include a substantial revision to the organisational approach to risk management and its reporting’.
The review of the HSE’s approach to risk management recognised that while significant progress had been achieved, challenges remained in implementing and embedding risk management in a manner that integrates both corporate and clinical governance across the health service.
The review report and its recommendations were accepted by the HSE Board at its September 2019 meeting.
The recommendations of the review included the need for the HSE to:
Adopt an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach
Establish an ERM Programme
Appoint a dedicated Chief Risk Officer.
The introduction of an ERM approach represents a significant change, and a properly resourced and structured change process will be required to ensure its success.
The Board has ensured budget provision for the establishment of these new arrangements as part of the NSP 2020.
Implementation of the review recommendations has commenced with:
(i) A comprehensive review of the risks on the Corporate Risk Register by the CEO and EMT in October 2019 (see below), and (ii) The initiation of the process to recruit a Chief Risk Officer.
The implementation of the other recommendations set out in the review report will be progressed during 2020.
4. Corporate Risks
The Corporate Risk Register is a key organisational document that allows the Board and the EMT to review and assess the HSE’s response to risk.
As noted above, each of the risks on the Corporate Risk Register is assigned to one of the four committees of the Board.
It is these committees, with the relevant members of the Executive, which scrutinise the risks and associated action plans.
During 2019 the organisation took a number of actions to mitigate identified corporate risks.
In October 2019 the CEO commenced a process with the EMT to undertake a comprehensive review of all the risks on the Corporate Risk Register to ensure that the Register identified all of the most significant risks facing the organisation, together with associated mitigating actions.
For each risk, an assessment was made of both impact and likelihood to give an overall ‘risk score’.
This review process was substantially completed in 2019 and identified the following as the highest risks facing the organisation at that time:
Healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance What drives the risk?
How are we managing the risk?
Healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can result in patients becoming sicker, placing additional demands on health service capacity in the case of AMR the longer term risks to the sustainability of healthcare services.
The ease with which microorganisms spread in healthcare settings both hospital and community.
Enhanced surveillance
Implementation of Ireland’s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) and 2019-2020 HSE Implementation Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control
National oversight of HCAI AMR Programme
Investment in additional infection prevention and control, surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship staff and communications
Governance and Our Organisation
Capacity and access demand
What is the risk?
What drives the risk?
How are we managing the risk?
Demographic pressures, high occupancy rates in acute hospital services and insufficient capacity across community and acute services can lead to a reduction in the quality of patient care and repeated failure to achieve standards of care.
Any sustained or exceptional level of demand for services, such as during the winter period can reduce the availability of services.
Providing additional acute hospital beds and homecare services as part of the Winter Plan
Recruitment of additional staff in community and hospital settings
Strengthening chronic disease management in the community
Working with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to provide additional capacity for planned and unplanned care in acute hospitals.
Medical and clinical workforce What is the risk?
Not having a sufficient number of critical staff in particular clinical staff, who have the required skills and professional qualifications, can impact on our ability to ensure safe and effective services.
A high reliance on agency staff and challenges recruiting and retaining medical, clinical and other critical workforce grades including the employment of consultants not on the specialist division register (SDR).
Establishment of Workforce Planning Unit
Developing new models of care
Review of current recruitment process
Workforce planning strategy and draft strategy Demand for Medical Consultants and Specialists to 2028
Additional HR support for key strategic workforce planning priorities
Clinical governance arrangements for non-SDR consultants.
Disability services
The way services for people with disabilities are currently organised and resourced can impact on our ability to ensure appropriate, safe and quality care.
Delays in moving to new models required to address increasing and changing need.
Residential placement committees now operate in each CHO to triage, and manage waiting lists and new referrals based on risk
The single assessment of need process was introduced to enable the residential placement process operate more efficiently and transparently
Commencing the operation of Children’s Disability Networks.
Capital infrastructure and critical equipment
Access to and the quality of health services is dependent on its built infrastructure and specialist equipment.
Inadequate built infrastructure and ageing critical clinical equipment, including ambulances.
Available capital funding has been prioritised to address infrastructural and clinical risk
Brexit may result in threats to the continuity for critical goods and services which ultimately could have an impact on patients and service users.
Uncertainty in relation to the final agreement between the UK and the EU.
HSE Brexit oversight group and steering group in place and meeting regularly
Planned preventive maintenance programmes are in place for all critical infrastructure and equipment.
Brexit
Risk assessments complete for each priority area and Brexit work plan in place
Service Provision Agreements signed with 21 UK Hospitals as a contingency measure for the current provision of services to Irish patients post Brexit
Additional warehouse storage capacity.
Other risks on the Corporate Risk Register are set out below:
Current configuration of hospitals
Cyber security
Managing change including culture change
Screening services
Organisational reputation
Policy and legislation development and implementation
Safety, health and wellbeing of staff
Individual performance management and accountability

Employment Levels
The health service is the largest employer in the state with just under 120,000 whole time equivalents (WTEs) employed by the HSE and section 38 agencies, as at 31 December 2019.
Since 2018, overall staffing levels have increased by 1.7% or 1,960 WTEs.
All staff categories, except general support (-0.4%/38 WTEs) showed growth in 2019 compared with 2018.
The largest growth was seen in nursing and midwifery (+561 WTEs) followed by patient and client care (+427 WTEs).
Medical and dental staffing was the third highest staff category showing an increase, with an additional 390 WTEs, of which 154 WTEs were consultants.
Table 1: WTEs by staff category
99% compliance with 30-minute breaks
99% compliance with weekly/fortnightly rest or equivalent compensatory rest.
Pay and Staffing Strategy
The 2019 Pay and Staffing Strategy reflected the key learning from 2018, and began with a central high-level affordability assessment of the level of staff, on an average cost per WTE basis, that the budget for 2019 could support.
This approach, designed to enable more realistic and affordable forecasting, followed on from the WTE limits process implemented in late 2018.
Key stakeholders and budget holders then operationalised the WTE limits taking account of service priorities and maintenance of existing services, while identifying the opportunities for optimisation and efficiencies.
Significant progress was made on aligning our workforce with the associated funding in 2019 with further key learning from this first full year of implementation being used to further strengthen and inform the process for 2020.

Listening to Our Service Users Listening to our Service Users
In order to provide high quality care, it is essential that we continually engage with patients and service users to ensure their views, concerns and experiences are at the centre of service delivery.
A number of areas were progressed during the year to promote patient and service user involvement across our health service.
While we have achieved good patient engagement at some levels within the organisation we also recognise that this is an evolving area of work.
We need to ensure that it continues to grow right throughout the organisation as we move to implement Sláintecare so that people who use our services are partnered with every step of the way to ensure that they are at the heart of the planning, design, delivery, implementation and evaluation of services. National Patient Experience Survey
Engaging and Partnering with People who use our Service
The survey, which first launched in 2017, is part of a broader programme to help improve the quality and safety of healthcare services provided to patients in Ireland by trying to understand how patients interact with the healthcare system and how they experience this process.
The 2019 survey contained a total of 61 questions on topics such as admission to hospital, care and treatment on the ward, trust in hospital staff, respect and dignity, and discharge from hospital.
All patients discharged in May aged 16 years and over, who spent 24 hours or more in one of the 40 participating hospitals and had a postal address in the Republic of Ireland, were asked during the year to complete the National Patient Experience Survey, a nationwide survey asking people for feedback about their stay in hospital.
In general, the findings were similar to those reported in 2018 with the exception of an improvement in the area of discharge of transfer.
While the survey results were generally positive, a significant number of patients did not have a good experience.
The sharing of these experiences helps identify areas where improvements are needed.
A further analysis on findings can be seen on page [27] of this Annual Report.
Over 12,300 people participated, a response rate of over 46%.

We established in 2019 a Cancer Patient Advisory Committee as part of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026.
A selection process was undertaken by a group comprising representatives of the Irish Cancer Society, the HSE’s National Cancer Control Programme, the DoH and a member of the former Cancer Patient Forum.
The Committee comprises 15 members and its establishment is a significant advance in developing health services to meet the needs of patients.
Engage: National Men’s Health Training was developed in response to the growing demand from service providers for support to improve their engagement and interaction with men.
The training content was based upon the partners’ experience, evidence from academic and evaluation literature, and an extensive 24-month pilot phase.
Nurses and midwives were encouraged during the year to collect patient stories, which were collected into a book The Patient is Paramount.
Great stories can offer us valuable feedback about our patients’ experiences of healthcare services, challenging us and enabling us to develop a deeper understanding of these experiences, encouraging problem solving, new learning and discovery.
Service user input was an integral part of the process undertaken to develop a strategic framework for health and social care professions setting out a roadmap for them to deliver on Sláintecare.
Service users were invited to be involved in all consultations.
In October, 300 staff and 50 patients attended a series of masterclasses/briefings on Partnering with Patients.
Work began in collaboration with the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care on the production of videos of personal experiences of palliative care across Ireland.
Your Voice Matters is a project which captures the lived experiences of service users and their families by inviting them to describe a recent instance of engaging with health and social care service, focusing on what is most important to service users and allowing the opportunity to capture both positive and negative feedback.
This information is then used to inform service improvements.
To date 1,135 stories have been collected with the following key themes emerging: –
The need for clear communication and information
The need for improved access to services.
Through the experiences gathered from Your Voice Matters a number of service improvement initiatives have been undertaken including the launch of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Peer Support Group in South Tipperary and COPD information leaflets and posters developed for use throughout the South East.
Engagement has begun with the Independent Patient Advocacy Service established by the DoH.
This new service will encourage patients to communicate with health services about any concerns.
A National Consent Policy Steering Group was convened.
Working groups have been established and have commenced a review of the policy and development of an e-learning programme.
Office of the Confidential Recipient The Office of Confidential Recipient is a national service that receives concerns/complaints such as allegations of abuse, negligence, mistreatment or poor care practices in HSE or HSE funded residential care facilities in an independent capacity and, in good faith, from patients, service users, families, other concerned individuals and staff members.
It has dealt with 896 formal concerns/complaints from across the country since its establishment in December 2014.
In 2019, the total number of formal concerns/complaints received by the Confidential Recipient was 155, a decrease of 51 on 2018.
The type of concerns raised included funding, leading to inappropriate placement, and lack of services for people with disabilities.
Appeals Service
The National Appeals Service ensures that applicants for eligibility schemes (e.g. medical cards/GP visit cards, residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions, Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS)) are given their correct entitlement, and also provides governance to the HSE in relation to the correct application of legislation, regulations and guidelines.
2,184 cases were processed in 2019, of which 32% were allowed or partially allowed.
The Appeals Service shares the learning from appeals, including feedback from appellants, with scheme managers and other relevant stakeholders.

Compliments and Complaints
Health Service Executive (Excluding voluntary hospitals and agencies) Many compliments go unrecorded and work is on-going to encourage all staff to record compliments as they provide important information on the positive aspects of our service to assist in learning from what is working well.
In 2019, there were 9,872 compliments recorded.
There were 5,938 formal complaints recorded in 2019 and examined by complaints officers under the Health Act 2004 (as amended) and the Disability Act 2005, see Table 3.
Of these, 719 were excluded from investigation under the Your Service Your Say complaints process or withdrawn.
Of the remaining 5,219 complaints, 3,398 or 65% were resolved by a complaints officer either informally or through formal investigation within 30 working days.
Voluntary Hospitals and Agencies There were 17,139 compliments recorded in 2019.
There were also 12,160 complaints recorded and examined by complaints officers.
Of the total number of complaints received 11,757 were investigated.
The other 403 were either excluded or withdrawn.
Of those investigated, 9,760 or 83% were resolved by a complaints officer either informally or through formal investigation within 30 working days.
Complaints under Parts 2 and 3 of the Disability Act 2005 1,244 complaints were received in 2019 under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 in relation to a child’s assessment of need for disability services, an increase of 68%.
842 complaints were received under part 2 of the Disability Act, 68% were recorded as resolved within 30 working days.
12 complaints were recorded as received under Part 3 of the Act, relating to access to buildings and services for people with disabilities.
Table 3: HSE Formal Complaints Received and % Dealt with Within 30 Working Days No. of complaints received
Data source: HSE Quality Assurance and Verification.
The introduction of the HSE’s Complaints Management System and increased staff training have resulted in enhanced reporting on formal complaints.
The number of complaints received now refers to those which are formally addressed by Complaints Officers only and no longer includes point of contact complaints, (which are reported separately) received by frontline services which have been immediately resolved.
This is reflected in 2019 data above in respect of both complaints received and those dealt with within 30 working days.
This figure includes 719 complaints received which were either excluded or subsequently withdrawn.

Learning from Feedback
Many people take the time to tell us about their experience of our services.
This feedback, much of which is positive also includes complaints.
Feedback, both positive and negative, can provide unique insights into the standards of care being provided to service users.
Being in a position to capture this feedback and experience is therefore central to how we learn and improve the quality of our services.
In 2019, the HSE began publishing quarterly casebooks on complaints received from the public and how they are addressed.
The complaints are anonymous and the purpose is to use it as a tool for learning and to facilitate the sharing of that learning.
This is a positive step as it provides an opportunity to publicly demonstrate our commitment to learn from the feedback we receive.
The establishment of the new independent Patient Advocacy Service in November 2019 provides a free, confidential and independent national service to help users of public hospitals making or intending to make a formal complaint through the HSE complaint process Your Service Your Say.
This new service will encourage patients to communicate with the health services first to resolve their complaint.
It aims to build positive relationships with the health services so that good communication is nurtured, and issues can be resolved efficiently and learned from.
Complaints addressed by Complaints Officers in HSE statutory services are either formal complaints or unresolved complaints escalated from point-of-contact in a frontline service.
During 2019, the HSE continued to support and empower staff to resolve complaints at point-of-contact through an interactive on-line module.
5,756 staff members have completed this module to date.
An additional 5,161 complaints were recorded as addressed by frontline staff as they occurred at point-of-contact.
Reform and Transformation
The Sláintecare Report (2017) and Sláintecare Implementation Strategy (2018) signal a new direction for the delivery of health and social care services in Ireland.
The implementation of Sláintecare has the potential to create a more sustainable, equitable, cost effective system that delivers better care and value for patient and services users.
At its core, the strategy focuses on establishing and delivering programmes of work to provide care closer to home at every stage of a person’s life, enabling our health service to be more responsive to patient and service user needs and to deliver better outcomes, with a strong focus on prevention and population health improvement.
A Sláintecare Action Plan 2019 was developed by the DoH and outlined the key areas of focus for the first full year of Sláintecare implementation.
It did this under four work-streams:
1. Service Redesign and Supporting Infrastructure
2. Safe Care, Co-ordinated Governance and Value for Money
3. Teams of the Future
4. Sharing Progress.
The vast majority of 2019 actions in the Sláintecare Action Plan have progressed in line with expectations and the 2020 Action Plan is in development.
This will include a particular focus on two priority Joint HSE/DoH Action Programmes of Capacity and Access and Regional Health Areas.
Given the need to ensure Sláintecare becomes fully embedded in everything we do, five high level reform and transformation priorities were identified for 2019:
Governance, leadership and corporate strategy
Transitional funding to shift the balance of care
Managing demand and continuing productivity improvement
Delivering programmes of work aligned to the Sláintecare Action Plan
Transformation support and enablement.
Transitional Funding to Shift the Balance of Care
The publication of the Government’s National Development Plan 2018-2027 has been a welcome development, creating a funding pipeline for capital developments that are aligned to Sláintecare.
In addition, in 2019 Sláintecare integration funding of approximately €20m was awarded to 91 projects from HSE or HSE funded services.
The objective of the integration fund is to test and then scale projects that are capable of achieving health or service improvements at a whole population level within the areas of chronic disease management and prevention, older persons’ services, health promotion and moving more care to the community.
Through productivity and service redesign, we have the opportunity to improve the quality of services for patients and create capacity to respond better to rising demand.
Large scale service redesign programmes were progressed, including work on the designation of major trauma centres and trauma networks, the elective care delivery model, clinical networks for specialists services (including nonconsultant led clinics), and urgent and emergency care networks.
Nine learning sites in the CHOs were agreed, representing the commencement of a phased implementation of the community healthcare network model that will respond to, among other priorities, the needs of people with chronic disease and those with frailty in the community.
Community Intervention Teams (CITs) were reviewed and re-focused to support the delivery of an increased volume of complex hospital avoidance and early discharge cases.
The Capacity and Access Joint Working Programme was jointly established by the HSE and DoH and work has commenced to deliver on the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review 2018.
These recommendations form the starting point for developing our capacity across acute and community services while, in parallel, reducing bed demand and improving the health of the population.
Work continued in 2019 to progress a number of programmes of work, including:
Several improvement initiatives commenced and continued in line with existing clinical programmes and international best practice in the area of scheduled and unscheduled care.
Design and development of new health service structures
Staff engagement
Population profiling
Development and implementation of eHealth initiatives
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Reform and Transformation
Review of existing service design for chronic disease and access to radiology
Future capacity expansion
Healthy Ireland and health and wellbeing initiatives
Strengthening clinical leadership.
In addition to the detail above, progress against many other 2019 priorities aligned with Sláintecare can be seen throughout this Annual Report.
Transformation Support and Enablement A dedicated Strategic Transformation Office has been established within the HSE to lead, drive and actively support implementation of the reform programme.
The office will also provide assurance to the Board, highlighting issues of concern and identifying corrective actions required.
The office will also support and enable services to deliver strategic reforms at frontline service level where it will be best experienced by our communities, people who use our services and their families.
Research and Evidence
We are striving towards the vision of making the HSE a health system renowned for its culture of building and using knowledge for health and wellbeing.
Research Activity in the HSE and its Funded Organisations was launched highlighting the significant level of research activity in the health service.
The first ever HSE Action Plan for Health Research 2019-2029 was also launched which provides a road map to build research capacity and culture in the health service in a way that delivers real patient impact.
Implementation of the National Health Library and Knowledge service continued with significant reform to provide equitable access to knowledge resources and service provision to all HSE healthcare staff.
The first milestones towards the development of an open access National eHealth Library were also successfully completed.
BMJ Best Practice, a point of care tool especially useful for primary and community services will be available nationally to enable evidence-based practice across the service in 2020.
Clinical, Quality and Patient Safety
Clinical Leadership
A review of the national clinical programmes was undertaken early in the year offering the opportunity to consolidate the programmes along themes that make sense to patients and service areas ensuring an integrated care approach to service design, in line with Sláintecare.
A number of recommendations were made following the review and work continues to implement these.
These recommendations include:
A strategic framework setting out a roadmap for HSCPs to deliver Sláintecare was substantially completed.
It was informed by a comprehensive consultation involving service users, HSCP and other key stakeholders.
The framework will be finalised early in 2020.
Enhancing Nursing
Midwifery Services
Establishment of a clinical forum
Alignment with principles of Sláintecare
Improved governance to connect, align and integrate clinical leadership
• 710 nurses/midwives were supported to undertake leadership training
Appointment of a National Lead for Integrated Care
Merging of certain clinical programmes.
4,000 staff accessed the Clinical Leadership Competency on-line resource
1,279 nurses and midwives now have authority to prescribe medicines
488 nurses and midwives registered as nurse and midwife referrers on HSE national database for nurse and midwife referrers of ionising radiation (x-ray)
National clinical programmes pilot and evaluate clinical designs that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.
During the year, work continued to deliver care through this approach, including
Completion of a COPD collaborative project which enabled care improvements in 18 participating hospitals
Commencement of a back pain pathway pilot
Commencement of a research project to develop a profile of Emergency Department (ED) attendees.
2,010 nurses and midwives were sponsored to undertake postgraduate education programmes
3,438 continuing education programmes were provided to 40,339 nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants
30 health service employees were sponsored nationally to commence training as nurses/midwives
Cystic Fibrosis
Paediatric Critical Care
COPD
Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services
Eating Disorders
The National Stroke Register Report 2018 was published
The report represents the largest data capture to date of Irish stroke trends, treatment and outcomes, processes of care and provision of therapy to patients.
The report showed encouraging trends in mortality from stroke due to blood clotting (ischaemic stroke) which is at a historic low of 7.8%, down from 10.9% in 2015.
The Clinical Director Development Programme continued to provide support to the clinical directorate, with the Executive Skills Programme commencing its third programme.
A health and social care professions (HSCP) leadership study was completed HSCP Leadership: An examination of context, impact, supports, challenges and areas for consideration.
It will inform plans to support and develop HSCP leadership in 2020.
Clinical, Quality and Patient Safety
Our aim is to continually improve the quality of care we deliver, learning from patient experience to ensure the safety of all who use our services.
In addition the Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services led on the development of a Health Passport for people with intellectual disabilities accessing healthcare settings.
This was launched and disseminated nationally.
It received Sláintecare project funding to support up scaling and further dissemination.
Clinical, Quality and Patient Safety
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and Infection Control
Significant improvements have been made in relation to AMR and infection control across the health service, with some key highlights as follows:
A process was developed for rapid whole genome sequencing to track the spread of carbapenemaseproducing enterobacterales (CPE) and other antibiotic resistant organisms.
A number of guidelines were developed/supported including:
A single World Health Organisation technique for performing hand hygiene has been agreed as the method being performed and taught.
Previously, there were two different methods in place which could cause confusion for staff moving between healthcare settings.
A survey was undertaken to learn about existing surveillance activities for surgical site infection.
Responses received indicated that 69% of respondents had local surveillance projects in place and strong interest was indicated in developing a national surveillance programme.
Work continues in establishing standard protocols and developing tools for data collection and analysis.
Campaigns were run to raise awareness amongst healthcare professionals and the general public including hse.ie/UndertheWeather, European Antibiotic Awareness Week, Hand Hygiene week and the winter campaign.
The first Director of Nursing for Infection Control and Prevention for the HSE was appointed.
A quality improvement project, working to improve antibiotic prescribing in the community, was planned and implemented with the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.
Balancing competing demands in relation to bed use related to infection prevention and control
Laboratory testing for CPE and the interpretation of clinical application of results
Prevention and control of CPE in patients on haemodialysis treatment
Infection control principles for buildings.
CPE screening was rolled out in acute hospitals.
A survey of hospital acquired infections and antimicrobial use in Irish hospitals in 2017 was published.
The EU wide survey in which 60 Irish hospitals (46 public and 14 private) volunteered, provided a snapshot of hospital acquired infections and antibiotic use across participating hospitals on a single day and there were welcome improvements from the previous survey in 2012.
All participating hospitals now have an infection prevention and control nurse and the number of single patient rooms has increased from 22% in 2012 to 28% in 2017.
Additionally, a reduction was seen in hospital acquired infections from indwelling devices (intravenous drips and urinary catheters).
Patient Safety Strategy 2019-2024 Keeping patients and service users safe is the overriding priority for those working in the health service.
National and international evidence however shows us that as many as one in eight patients suffer harm while using healthcare services, with up to 70% of this harm being preventable.
Many excellent patient safety initiatives have been implemented in recent years resulting in measureable improvements.
The development of the strategy builds on this and is an important example of how real and meaningful partnerships between patients and those working at each level of the health service can generate a shared vision for a more compassionate health service, one that learns when things go wrong, responds accordingly and reduces harm to those who entrust their lives and care to us.
The strategy sets out six commitments:
Empower and engage patients to improve patient safety
Empower staff to improve patient safety
Anticipate and respond to risks to patient safety
Reduce common causes of harm
Measure and learn to improve patient safety
Provide effective leadership and governance to improve patient safety.
The Patient Safety Strategy 2019-2024 is aligned closely with Sláintecare.
A high level implementation plan and communication plan are in development and engagement has commenced with various stakeholders throughout the service.
A consultation process is also being rolled out to seek input into how best to support services in the strategy’s implementation.
The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 was published which will legislate for a number of important patient safety measures.
The legislation established a robust framework for mandatory open disclosure and includes a new process to designate patient safety incidents for which mandatory open disclosure must occur.
A second purpose of the new legislation is to enable national learning and to support health service wide improvements so that harm to patients can be prevented.
Further information on open disclosure can be seen in the Safeguarding and Protection section of this Annual Report.
The HSE was awarded a global sepsis award for its significant efforts to increase sepsis awareness and raise the quality of sepsis prevention and management.
The jury was particularly impressed by the improvement of recognition of sepsis, by all clinicians, in patients who are deteriorating due to an infection.
Early detection and treatment of sepsis is crucial in reducing the mortality rate.
Between 2011 and 2018, the number of cases reported in adults increased from 6,495 to 15,379 indicating increased recognition and reporting of sepsis.
This was accompanied by a reduction in the mortality from 26.8% to 19.4% in the same time period.
• The Medication Safety programme delivered three phases of the Know Check Ask campaign, encouraging people to know their medicines and keep a list, check that they are using the right medicine the right way and ask their healthcare professional if they are unsure.
All pharmacies, GPs, primary care and health centres received campaign posters, and pharmacies also received My Medicines Lists.
To reduce avoidable falls and pressure ulcers, and increase the capacity of quality improvement knowledge and skills within the system, two concurrent quality improvement collaboratives took place in Cork and in Cavan, involving 26 multi-disciplinary teams and over 170 participants.
Clinical audit skills training was delivered to 173 staff from acute and community services.
Audits from the National Office of Clinical Audit are used to recognise areas of excellence and those requiring improvement, including identifying outliers in acute services.
The audits also support policy development, service planning, best practice and reporting.
The Stroke Register was transitioned to a National Clinical Audit of Stroke
The first national report for the Irish National Clinical Audit of Intensive Care Units was published
New quarterly dashboards for the Irish Hip Fracture Database were implemented.
The building of quality improvement capacity and capability across all services continued through designing, developing and delivering the following learning programmes: –
Diploma in Leadership and Quality in Healthcare and the Diploma in Quality for Community Care
Foundation in Quality Improvement Programme.
Quality improvement talktime webinars cover a wide range of topics and feature national and international speakers.
There were over 21 webinars and on average 79 participants per webinar in 2019 and their regular broadcast continues to build a network of quality improvers in our health service.
The Final Report of the Evaluation of the Introduction of Schwartz Rounds in Ireland was launched.
The report highlighted that Schwartz Rounds benefit teamwork and support reductions in staff stress levels by offering a forum for staff to share experiences in a structured environment, irrespective of their role or status within the organisation.
27 services across the country are now introducing Schwartz Rounds and the numbers continue to grow.
Significant work was undertaken with services to enable patient safety improvements in the following priority areas: –
Medication safety
Quality Improvement for Healthcare Boards
Deteriorating patient.
Safeguarding and Protection
Safeguarding
Further details on the HSE safeguarding service including reports are on hse.ie/safeguarding.
The Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse – National Policy and Procedures (HSE Adult Safeguarding Policy) resulted in the setting up of Safeguarding and Protection Teams (SPTs) and the HSE National Safeguarding Office. This policy publicly declared a ‘No Tolerance’ approach to any form of abuse and for all services to promote a culture which supports this ethos. •
There are now over 70 social work staff in SPTs supported by administrative staff.
There are over 1,700 designated officers across the social care sector with lead safeguarding roles.
An independent inter-sectoral National Safeguarding Committee has been developed now known as Safeguarding Ireland, which involves over 30 partners across public, voluntary and private sectors is working to promote and advance the rights of vulnerable adults at a national level.
The National Safeguarding Office Annual Report 2018 was published.
11,780 safeguarding concerns were received, representing a 14% increase on 2017
For those aged 18 to 64 years of age, the most significant category of abuse alleged remains physical abuse at 50%, followed by psychological abuse at 31%
For those aged over 65 years, the most significant category of abuse alleged is psychological abuse at 33%, with physical abuse at 26% and financial abuse at 21%
Over the past three years, an extensive programme of awareness training has been implemented for over 55,000 staff.
1,743 designated officers with a lead role for screening and notifying cases of alleged abuse and neglect, who have undergone training are registered, 384 of whom were newly trained in 2018.
A review of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse – National Policy and Procedures which commenced in 2017 was completed.
The revised policy will be implemented in three phases and the first preparatory phase will take place in 2020.
Public Awareness Campaign 2019
Public awareness campaigns, commissioned by Safeguarding Ireland have focused on the prevention of abuse, planning ahead and the need for greater conversations around abuse within society.
The 2019 campaign which was launched in May found that:
10% of Irish adults have witnessed adult abuse in the past year and 81% have said that tougher laws would encourage them to take greater action to combat abuse
12% of those who witnessed abuse of a vulnerable adult in the past year did nothing at all, while 47% discussed it with the person being abused and 40% discussed it with a trusted person
Just 15% sought professional advice and 3% reported what they witnessed to an authority such as the HSE or Gardaí.
The hse.ie/safeguarding page received more visitors during May than at any other point in the year illustrating that the public awareness campaign has a positive impact on social media traffic to sites associated with safeguarding.
The National Independent Review Panel (NIRP) was established in 2017 to undertake reviews of serious cases within disability services across the health service.
The NIRP review the circumstances surrounding such cases and present reports to the HSE on its findings and recommendations relating to service improvement.
In addition, the NIRP produces an annual report and aggregate analysis of the cases investigated, to ensure that the learning can be disseminated across health and social care services nationally.
Updated operational guidelines were published in March, setting out the purpose and principles of the NIRP and providing clear guidance on the process to be followed for all reviews.
Open Disclosure
A revised Open Disclosure Policy Communicating with Patients Following Patient Safety Incidents was published and launched in 2019.
Open disclosure means that patients and their relevant person(s), as appropriate, will be communicated with in an open, honest, timely and transparent manner if: •
Something goes wrong with patient care
Patients experience harm as a result of their care
We think that harm may have occurred as a result of patient care.
Under the revised policy, patients have a right to:
Full knowledge about their care and treatment
Be informed when things go wrong
Meet with us to discuss what happened
A sincere apology if we made an error while caring for them
Be treated with compassion and empathy.
The National Open Disclosure policy, programme and training programme is co-ordinated via the National Open Disclosure Office which was established in May.
To date over 45,000 staff have accessed open disclosure training with over 400 staff now trained as trainers across all care areas.
The national office also supports the implementation of open disclosure legislation across all health and social care services.
An Open Disclosure Steering Group has been established.
Its role is to oversee the progress of the Open Disclosure programme of work.
In fulfilling this role, the National Open Disclosure Steering Committee will champion, advance, support and provide strategic advice on the on-going implementation of the National Open Disclosure Programme and policy.
The Steering Group has developed a governance framework for monitoring and evaluating the policy and compliance with its application throughout the HSE.
The full policy is available on hse.ie.
A revised HSE Child Protection and Welfare Policy was published, aligning with the requirements outlined under the Children First Act 2015 and the principles of the Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.
Over 50,000 staff across the HSE and HSE funded and contracted services completed the mandatory HSE programme An Introduction to Children First, bringing the total number trained to over 220,000 since 2016.
A new training programme was developed and piloted in preparation for roll-out from 2020.
Since publication of this Annual Report 2019 and typographical error made, the number of Protected Disclosures was amended from 2,105 to 57.
Operational Performance
Community healthcare
Operational performance in 2019 was measured primarily on the basis of how we delivered against our NSP for 2019
which set out the type and volume of health and social care services to be provided by the HSE in 2019, in response to the funding made available and the level of staff to be deployed.
Priorities and Actions
The NSP 2019 has over 125 priorities with 555 supporting actions across all areas of service delivery and enabling functions.
Mental health services
Difficulties were experienced in recruiting and retaining skilled staff across mental health services.
Particular challenges were experienced in delivering 7/7 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) due to the lack of consultants nationally and internationally.
Key performance indicators and activity levels
A high level overview is provided below on the key performance indicators and activity data 2019 against 2018.
Any risks are being mitigated through further engagement with relevant stakeholders to resolve issues and where relevant are included in risk registers.
Older persons’ services
Waiting lists for home support have become a feature of the service as resources have not kept pace with population growth or with the increasing dependency of the growing numbers of people aged over 80 years, within the over 65 years’ cohort.
There was an increase in the number of home support hours provided in 2019 (2.1%); however the numbers in receipt of home support from intensive homecare packages decreased (-7.2%).
The National Transitional Care Scheme assists patients in acute hospitals who are ready for discharge but need nursing homecare or a period of convalescence up to a maximum of 4 weeks.
The scheme funds these patients in private nursing homes which facilitates the timely discharge of patients from acute hospitals.
Compliance with regulations following HIQA inspections worsened (10.2%)
€13m for NHSS to reduce period awaiting funding to four weeks until 31 December 2019
€4.2m transitional care funding to support discharge from acute hospitals
€2m for home support packages to support delayed transfers of care and community waiting lists
A high level overview is provided below on the acute key performance indicators and activity data 2019 against 2018. 
There was an increase in overall acute activity (inpatient and day case) (1.5%) but specifically day case treatment (2.8%).
The total number of people waiting for an inpatient or day case appointment fell in 2019, notwithstanding the impact of four strike days resulting in a loss of over 9,500 cases.
The HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) continue to focus on both the total number of people waiting and those people waiting the longest and will continue in 2020 to agree individual treatment plans for patients within the public system or externally where appropriate.
Our outpatient waiting lists remain a significant challenge.
Operational Performance
The number of older people in receipt of home support at any time varies depending on the level of need of those in receipt of services.
Despite the significant resource allocated to home support, demand for home support continues to exceed the level of service that can be funded.
Population Health and Wellbeing
Population health and wellbeing is about helping our whole population to stay healthy and well by focusing on prevention, protection and health promotion and improvement.
Supporting and improving the health of the population is a fundamental goal of developing a sustainable health service.
Sláintecare recognises the importance of supporting people to look after and protect their own health and wellbeing.
Healthy Ireland, the national strategy for improved health and wellbeing, is underpinned by a whole-system philosophy involving cross-government and cross-societal responsibility.
The health system continues to play an important leadership role in driving a whole-system shift towards a culture in Ireland that places greater emphasis and value on prevention and keeping people well. • Healthy Eating and Active Living Programme –
The HSE funded Community Cooking Programme Healthy Food Made Easy is a six week programme delivered in disadvantaged communities to support people to better understand nutrition and to learn cooking skills.
5,100 people attended community cooking programmes around the country.
The new Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy for Adult Patients in Acute Hospitals was launched.
A toolkit to support local implementation was also developed and is available on hse.ie.
This new policy aims to ensure that all adult patients in acute hospitals receive a patient-centred food and nutrition service, from their admission to their discharge from hospital.
Delivery of the START campaign in partnership with Safefood continued, offering families a number of practical, achievable tips to help make healthier lifestyle changes.
The campaign which is underpinned by A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025 and Healthy Weight for Children (0-6 years) Framework connected directly with families through the GAA semi-final in Croke Park and the National Ploughing Championships.
Health and Wellbeing
Implementing the Healthy Ireland Framework
Healthy Ireland Implementation Plans were launched for the two remaining CHOs with implementation plans now in place for all nine CHOs.
Implementation of Healthy Ireland plans continued in five of the seven Hospital Groups.
The report highlights how the men who successfully engaged in a 12 week physical activity programme in eight Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) reduced their weight and cardiovascular risk by 30% and improved their overall health and wellbeing.
Work commenced on rolling out the programme across the national network of 29 LSPs.

It should be noted that for coverage purposes, CervicalCheck reports only those tests carried out in a primary care setting and these equated to 206,315 in 2019 compared to 339,161 in 2018.
Since the programme started in 2008, more than 3m screening tests have been carried out and the rates of cervical cancer in Ireland have decreased by 7% year on year.
Over 100,000 cases of abnormal cervical cells have been detected, many of which could have developed into cancer if not detected.
234,000 smear tests in all settings were carried out in 2019 compared to 370,000 in 2018.
The increase in 2018 was due to the demand for out-of-cycle screening tests during the CervicalCheck crisis.

The revised framework was used by an Independent Assessment Panel to review submissions from six Dublin hospitals identified as options for the Major Trauma Centre and Dublin Trauma Units.
The panel will provide advice to the HSE in early 2020 on the hospitals to be designated as the Major Trauma Centre for the Central Trauma Network and Dublin Trauma Units and the HSE will make a recommendation to the Minister.
The appointment of a National Clinical Lead for Trauma Services in June, one of the immediate actions prioritised in the report, will provide an essential foundation for the implementation and oversight of the new trauma system.
Cancer Services
The key focus in progressing cancer services in 2019 was the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026.
The strategy sets out four key priorities: reduce the cancer burden; provide optimal care; maximise patient involvement and quality of life; and enable and assure change.
Reducing the cancer burden • 
The plan is aimed at tackling the most common type of cancer in Ireland.
The Plan focuses on the fact that most skin cancers could be prevented and has identified the priority groups as children, outdoor workers, those who participate in outdoor leisure activities and sunbed users.
The Irish Cancer Prevention Network was established by the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), Marie Keating Foundation, Irish Cancer Society and Breakthrough Cancer Research.
The network encourages collaborative working with the aim of reducing cancer risk for the population.
Establishment of an early detection Board progressed with three meetings held.
Implementation Report on National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 The first implementation report on the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 was published, setting out the progress achieved on the 52 recommendations of the strategy.
The report found that significant progress has been made since the launch of the strategy, with key highlights including: •
Integration of cancer prevention into the messaging under Healthy Ireland
Uptake rates for cancer screening
Publication of a model of care for oral anti-cancer medications
Progress being made by Working Groups on survivorship and psycho-oncology
Ensuring appropriate staff are in place remains a challenge for the specialist cancer workforce.
However, key appointments continue to be made to ensure better, safer services for our patients
The pilot phase for the New Cancer Framework for Quality and Safety concluded during the year, with next steps including its national roll-out for lung cancer.
Additional information on other key highlights can be found further in this section.
Women and Children’s Services
National Women and Infants’ Health Programme
Ireland’s first National Maternity Strategy
Creating a Better Future Together was launched in 2016.
The strategy sets out a blueprint to significantly improve the service provided to mothers and their babies, and its implementation is a key focus for the health service.
During the year, work progressed to address the priorities of the strategy and examples of this can be seen below.
A particular focus was assigned to the supported care pathway.
This pathway, identified as the least developed across maternity services, is intended for pregnancies deemed to be normal-risk where care is primarily delivered by midwives working within a multi-disciplinary framework.
A baseline review of maternity services was conducted and completed.
This review found that 10% to 35% of women were now being managed within the supported care pathway during the antenatal period, across 16 maternity hospitals/units.
The review also identified that women in the supported care pathway engage in a shared model of care with their GP.
15 of the 16 services had a community based presence of which 10 provided booking in clinics in the community.
Each maternity network is at a different level of development.
During 2019 advances were made across each but further work on their development is required.
Currently, maternity networks also provide other services including termination of pregnancy, general gynaecology (including creating capacity for colposcopy clinics), and fertility services.
Work is also underway to transition the home birth service into the maternity networks, further emphasising the important role the maternity networks play across primary and secondary care, as well as health and wellbeing.
Fourteen maternity units/hospitals now provide women with a 20-week foetal anomaly scan, and a fifteenth site provides the scan but at a later stage in pregnancy.
The remaining four units are working towards full provision as posts are filled and capacity grows on the ground.
A national plan for ambulatory gynaecology was developed.
The aim of the plan is to increase the capacity in the area of general gynaecology, with the objective of reducing waiting times for women, which is inclusive of patients with endometriosis.
The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory (see and treat) care model rather than the traditional care model of outpatient referral to day case/inpatient procedure.
A Clinical Lead for Termination of Pregnancy services was appointed at the end of 2019.
Further information can be seen on page [49] of this Annual Report.
Paediatric Model of Care
Continuing to oversee the new children’s hospital development and development of paediatric services •
In January 2019, the three children’s hospitals in Dublin and the Children’s Hospital Group transitioned from four separate, independently governed entities into one new single organisation, CHI.
The new Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital opened in July, providing a range of services.
The Urgent Care Centre treats minor injuries or illnesses that require prompt treatment, but are not life threatening.
The Paediatric Outpatient Department is expected to see up to 17,000 children a year, once fully operational and should contribute to significant reductions in waiting lists.
In its first five months of opening the general paediatric waiting list fell by 38%.
The Centre also contains a HSE Dental Unit and Child Sexual Abuse Assessment and Treatment Unit.
The HSE continued to work with the DoH, CHI and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to progress the opening of the second Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght and the new Children’s Hospital.
Further development of the regional paediatric units in CUH, University Hospital Galway (UHG) and University Hospital Limerick (UHL) through the recruitment of additional paediatric consultants will aid the implementation of one of the key concepts of the National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services which is to provide care as close to the patient’s home as is clinically appropriate.
A €1.2m capital investment project saw the Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) Unit at CHI move to a larger purpose built outpatient facility in September.
The treatment of CRY involves the comprehensive evaluation and treatment of those diagnosed with, or at risk from, inherited heart conditions that are a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the young.
Additional staff were recruited to support additional services in CHI including: – Rheumatology services – Haematology stem cell service – Outpatient antibiotic therapy – Neurosurgery services.
Scoliosis services continued to be developed to reduce access waiting times for surgery.
National Ambulance Service Pre-Hospital and Acute Hospital Services
The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is the statutory pre-hospital emergency and intermediate care provider for the State.
In the Dublin metropolitan area, ambulance services which are funded by the HSE are provided by the NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade.
The NAS responds to emergency and urgent calls, transports intermediate care patients and undertakes adult, paediatric and neonatal retrievals.
Supporting the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy
Work has continued to support and expand community first responder schemes with over 260 community first responder groups and over 4,000 community volunteers now in place throughout the country.
The NAS Critical Care Retrieval Service held its inaugural symposium in June.
The theme of the symposium was Connectivity in Critical Illness and there was excellent representation from all areas of the health service, the DoH and from the Northern Ireland Retrieval Service.
The NAS in partnership with mental health services initiated a new YourMentalHealth information phone line in October to provide information on mental health supports and services across the country.
Operating 24/7, the Freephone number is 1800 742 444 informing service users on the local supports and services available and how to access them.
In preparation for the phone line going live, the NAS call takers received additional training from mental health professionals to assist them in signposting the most appropriate service.
Implementation of A Trauma System for Ireland – Report of the Trauma Steering Group
A service level agreement was reached between the HSE and Irish Community Rapid Response to provide an aeromedical service from Rathcoole Aerodrome near Millstreet in Co. Cork.
The service went live in July 2019.
Trauma and orthopaedic bypass protocols were implemented from Portiuncula to Galway and from Naas to Tallaght.
Delivery of improved governance and patient safety
Work on the implementation of the NAS Fleet and Equipment Plan continued.
This included the procurement of new special purpose, specially adapted vehicles which allow the NAS to be winter ready.
These vehicles are four-wheel drive and will assist in the delivery of pre-hospital care during adverse weather conditions.
A NAS Business and Data Analysis team has been established to strengthen clinical governance.
The team will support the analysis of clinical information assisting in understanding patient demographics, treatments provided, etc. in a more timely manner.
The Emergency Motorcycle Response Unit was launched in Cork City.
This unit provides a rapid response to serious and life threatening 112/999 calls and is able to manoeuvre more quickly through heavy traffic or difficult to access areas to stabilise the patient before ambulance arrival.

Office of Chief Information Officer
The Office of the Chief Information Officer delivers ICT services and support throughout the HSE, facilitating integration within and across community services, hospitals and other specialised care providers.
In 2019, the ICT capital allocation was €85m.
Some key projects were progressed which advanced implementation of Sláintecare.
The Individual Health Identifier (IHI) enables the identification of patients and clients availing of health services and their health records and is critical for eHealth and Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
The IHI is operated by the Health Identifier Service, which was formally established this year as part of Sláintecare.
The technical infrastructure supporting the IHI Register, originally populated in 2017 with 6.7m records, has been operational since 2017 and is providing IHI numbers for 8,000 electronic transactions per day.
A programme of work was completed in 2019 to enhance and improve the IHI’s record matching capability.
To date IHI numbers have been created for 8m individuals in Ireland.
A foundational programme to guide staff through utilising the digital tools they already have access to and to build on their digital literacy skills was launched in conjunction with Health Business Services (HBS) and in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.
Its aims are to inspire and encourage staff to become confident on-line by working on existing digital platforms and services along with fostering valuable partnerships in supporting digital transformation.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
4,500 devices (laptops, desktops) and 3,900 smartphones have been delivered to front line community-based staff, including public health nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dental staff, dieticians etc.
This was a national project and included all nine CHOs.
Communications technology upgrades were undertaken to support existing and new community sites including 18 fixed telephony upgrades, 20 new builds and over 50 network connections.
The Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System Project is the design and implementation of an EHR for all women and babies in maternity and neonatology services in Ireland.
This record allows patient information to be shared with relevant providers of care, in a standardised format, as and when required through the use of a technology enabled solution.
The inaugural Digital Academy Forum was held in September 2019.
These Forums will be held quarterly and are a place for sharing and shaping thought and practice on digital health issues, digital transformation and innovations across the health service by medical staff, academics, industry leaders, patients and citizens.
National Human Resources
Developing a new People Strategy •
The development process for the new People Strategy was completed following a comprehensive consultation process.
Work continued to implement People’s Needs Defining Change – Health Services Change Guide through a focus on communication and awareness, education and practice development, synergy at national level and change practice improvement within the delivery system.
The Health Services Change Guide is the policy framework and agreed approach to change for the health service and is a key foundation for delivering the people and culture change required to implement Sláintecare, public sector reform and corporate priorities.
A review of the existing Recruitment Model was carried out.
Initial work has commenced on this model and is expected to be completed in 2020. •
The Health Service Leadership Academy delivered one cohort of each of the flagship leadership development programmes, Leading Care I, Leading Care II and Leading Care III.
The Health Service Leadership Academy HSE won the national award for the best Learning and Development Strategy at the HR Leadership and Management Awards.
An Action Plan was developed in response to the results of the 2018 staff survey findings.
This document defines staff engagement, highlights the benefits for staff and patients of having an engaged workforce, and emphasises that staff engagement is a core component in developing policies and strategies.
The implementation of a single National Integrated Staff Records and Payroll (NiSRP) system is currently being rolled out nationally.
The programme went live in the East and plans are at an advanced stage for implementation in the South East in May 2020.
A National Steering Group, co-chaired by Quality Improvement and National HR, is in place to oversee the implementation of the Linking Service and Safety Strategy which addresses work related violence and aggression.
A status update on this strategy is currently underway.
The Healthy Workplace Framework will focus on the physical, psychosocial and personal health of staff in the workplace.
Work commenced during the year on the development of a resource pack to provide information for managers and their staff on developing a healthy workplace including the supports/resources available to support implementation.
The Healthy Workplace Framework is expected to be launched in 2020.
Critical incident stress management training is on-going nationally with three training sessions, covering 32 newly trained staff, and 12 in-service supervision training days undertaken.

Appendix 5: Annual Energy Efficiency Report Appendix 5
In response to legislation SI 426 of 2014 (previously SI 542 of 2009), which requires public sector organisations to report annually, this appendix outlines the HSE’s position on its energy use and actions taken to reduce consumption.
As one of the largest public sector energy users the health service must act as an exemplar of best practice in taking climate action, reducing emissions and the mitigation of the adverse health effects of climate change.
Key measures set out in the Climate Action Plan for the public sector include targets of 50% energy efficiency and 30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030.
In addition, all public sector buildings, including healthcare buildings, must be upgraded to a B2 energy rating which will require an unprecedented major refurbishment programme.
A number of programmes of work have been established as part of the Estates Energy Reduction Implementation Plan.
Overview of Energy Usage in 2019
The National Health Sustainability Office is fully compliant with the requirements of SI 426 and has verified all HSE meter points for 2019.
This data is currently being validated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and it is anticipated that this verified energy consumption data will be available from the SEAI in mid-2020.
The overview below is the verified energy usage in 2018 (excluding section 38 and section 39 agencies).
The verified 2019 energy usage, when issued by SEAI, will be made available at hse.ie/sustainability.
HBS Estates Offices improved energy management practices and performance through the formation of Estates Energy Bureaux, which were established in partnership with the SEAI.
This was developed as a scalable pilot initiative in the East Region and roll-out to the West and South Areas progressed in 2019.
This included the implementation of energy awareness programmes and development of registers of opportunities for energy efficiency projects in order to progress grant funding for projects.
Initial Energy Efficiency Projects which were identified on registers of opportunities were progressed.
The requirement for an Energy Efficient Design Review is now included in the Scope of Services for design teams for new projects and major refurbishments.
This ensures the design of new healthcare buildings maximise energy efficiency and are in compliance with energy standards. •
Operating and Financial Overview 2019
Financial Governance
Introduction 2019 was a year of continued challenges for the HSE driven by the complexities of on-going demand for services in our acute, community and social care services.
It was also a year that saw the welcomed re-establishment, on the 28 June 2019, of an external Board arising from the introduction of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019.
Four committees have been established to help the Board in the performance of its functions.
These committees are: •
Audit and Risk Committee
People and Culture Committee
Performance and Delivery Committee
Safety and Quality Committee
The HSE is currently in the process of developing a new corporate plan, fully informed by Sláintecare, which will focus on providing a clear medium-term roadmap for staff, patients, service users and all stakeholders.
Strategic Context
The HSE is required to use the resources available to it to deliver the type and volume of services provided for in the national service plan while prioritising improving the health of the population through promoting wellness and the provision of safe health and social care services for the citizens of Ireland.
The environment in which the HSE operates is increasingly complex.
There were over 4.9 million (m) people living in Ireland during 2019 representing a 3.8% increase since Census 2016 and 8.1% since 2010.
According to the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI), the population in Ireland will have increased by circa another 1.1m people by the end of 2030 therefore adding to the number of people requiring HSE services.
People in Ireland are also living longer and life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost two and a half years since 2007.
The increase in life expectancy in Ireland was consistently higher than the EU average over the past decade.
These predicted changes in our population will have implications for how we fund and deliver increasingly complex care and services.
While the population is growing across age groups, the most significant increases are evident in the age group cohort of 65 years or over.
The ESRI has predicted that by 2030 the share of the population aged 65 and over will have increased from 1 in 8 to 1 in 6 while the number of people aged over 85 is expected to double.
Lifestyle factors also contribute to the complexity of health provision in Ireland.
This includes the impact of smoking, drug use, alcohol consumption and obesity.
While the number of adults smoking in Ireland has decreased from 27% in 2002 to 14% in 2019, almost one third of Irish adults reported regular heavy alcohol intake and the obesity rates in Ireland has increased from 15% in 2007 to 18% by 2015.
The HSE is fully supportive of the need to make significant changes to the current models of health and social care and is committed to working with Sláintecare Programme and the Department of Health to deliver this change.
This will involve a greater cross government and society focus on helping people to stay healthy, new and more integrated models of health and social care, including better integration with the voluntary sector, and greater involvement of citizens, patients and service users in the design and delivery of care.
Sláintecare sets out the vision to deliver a transformation in the way care is organised, delivered and experienced in Ireland over the next 8 to 10 years, which aims to achieve more positive experiences and better outcomes for patients, service users and local communities.
Significant efforts have been made during 2019 to improve the overall financial planning and financial management of the HSE which resulted in the delivery of a small surplus on our non-capital expenditure of €60.5m or 0.35% of total funding.
Income Analysis
The HSE received revenue funding from the DoH of €16.471bn for the provision of health and social care services.
This included the allocation of once off net additional funding of €426m provided by way of a supplementary estimate for 2019.
Of the supplementary estimate received €50m was available for acute services, €50m for disabilities, €157m for Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), €26m for Winter Plan, €51m for pay agreements, €9m for Brexit and €83m for areas such as State Claims Agency costs and which also covers demand led areas such as pensions and overseas treatment.
Overall this represented an increase of circa €1.249 billion or an 8.2% increase over 2018.

Table 6: HSE Income Graph 2005 to 2019 While Table 6 shows that there has been an increase in HSE income and funding particularly in the years since 2016, this has to be looked at in the context of the percentage changes in public health expenditure by capita which has been reflected in Table 7.

Table 7: Percentage Changes in Public Health Expenditure Per Capita, 2010 to 2018 Irish public health expenditure (capital and revenue) has been on the increase from a low of €13.4bn in 2013 to €17.9bn in 2019.
However, the rate of increase for each person in Ireland is far slower than the average Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) increase.
In fact, between 2010 and 2018, the per person increase in public health expenditure was 17% in Ireland versus an average 25% across the 36 OECD countries. 30% 25%

Total Expenditure
Expenditure and Outcome Analysis At the end of 2019 the HSE delivered a modest surplus of income over expenditure of €60.5m or 0.35% of its overall income.
This surplus arose primarily as a result of one off funding measures and savings that are not expected to be replicated in 2020.
The year remained challenging in operational services particularly in the area of acute hospital operations which reported a deficit in 2019 arising from greater than anticipated expenditure directly related to operational activity and demand for services.
In general, the impact of additional supplementary funding and savings measures enabled other key service areas to report surpluses for 2019 which are not necessarily achievable in 2020.
The overall expenditure reported for 2019 is €17.238bn which is 7% higher than the expenditure in 2018.
The table above analyses this expenditure by HSE service area.
Primary care and social care together account for circa 44% of the expenditure whilst the provision of acute hospital and National Ambulance Services accounts for almost 40% of that spend.
The overall increased expenditure in 2019 of 7% or €1.1bn is mainly in respect of additional pay measures, payment of consultant settlements and increased expenditure in respect of demand led areas such as pensions and state claims agency.
A more detailed analysis per service area is provided later in this report.
Acute Hospitals Services Acute services are provided for adults and children within six Hospital Groups, Children’s Health Ireland and the National Ambulance Service (NAS).
These services include scheduled care (planned care), unscheduled care (unplanned/ emergency care), diagnostics, cancer treatment, maternity and children’s services, as well as the pre-hospital emergency and intermediate care provided by NAS.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Acute hospitals continually work to improve access to healthcare, whilst striving to ensure that quality and patient safety issues, including the management of infection, are prioritised within allocated budgets.
The six Hospital Groups provide the structure to deliver an integrated hospital network of acute care to the adult population in each geographic area.
Children’s Health Ireland provides paediatric services in the greater Dublin area and incorporates the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which is responsible for overseeing the building of the new children’s hospital.
Overall the acute hospitals services reported a deficit for 2019.
Operational service pressures drove increased clinical non pay cost, particularly drugs and laboratory.
Other non-pay cost pressures include cleaning and maintenance required in respect of increased infection control and compliance requirements.
From an income perspective, the continued reduction in receipts from hospital private maintenance changes continues to be a challenge.
The volume of inpatient activity was marginally below the target set out in the NSP 2019 (0.1%), although overall complexity was slightly higher than planned (0.2%).
Day case activity exceeded the targets set out in the NSP 2019, in terms of both activity volume and overall complexity (3.5% and 4.3% respectively).
Outpatient activity was also ahead of NSP 2019 target (0.4%).
The higher than expected operational costs experienced is significantly driven by this level of service delivery.
Social Care – Comprising Disability and Older Persons Services
The challenge in 2019 for the social care services was to continue to meet the rising demand for services as a result of an aging population with a longer life expectancy.
Primary Care Services
Managing the year on year growth in demand for communitybased social services has been one of the key challenges for older persons’ services in 2019.
The largest increase in Ireland’s population is in the age range of 65 and over, presenting a particular challenge for serving a growing, ageing and increasingly diverse population with more complex service needs.
Older persons services provide a wide range of services including home supports, community supports, intermediate care (both residential and in the home), as well as short stay and long stay care when remaining at home is no longer feasible (Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS)).
Overall the surplus reported in the older persons services has arisen from one time savings and a brought forward first surplus from 2018.
Disability Services
Disability services are provided to those with physical, sensory, intellectual disability and autism in day, respite and residential settings.
Services include personal assistant, home support, multi-disciplinary and other community supports.
The costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, including the provision of emergency placements, where individual placements can cost up to €0.5m, continued to be a significant financial pressure for this service area in 2019.
The cost is primarily driven by the clients need and the complexity of each individual case presenting.
Another significant increased spend in 2019 related to the cost associated with home support hours compared to other years in order to mitigate high cost residential placements.
Overall this service area reported a deficit in the year under review.
Mental Health Services
Specialist mental health services are provided in local community areas.
These services include acute inpatient services, day hospitals, outpatient clinics, community-based mental health teams (CAMHS, general adult and psychiatry of later life services), mental health of intellectual disability, community residential and continuing care residential services.
Sub-specialties include rehabilitation and recovery, eating disorders, liaison psychiatry and perinatal mental health.
A National Forensic Mental Health Service is also provided, including inpatient and in-reach prison services with a new modern and fit for purpose facility, increasing capacity to 130 beds, opening in 2020.
Primary care centres will support the strategic shift of care and services to primary care, ensuring better access to care, offering individuals and families a one stop shop to a broad range of primary care services in the community.
Of the 341 prioritised locations identified in 2012, 129 are operational at the end of 2019 with 74 in the process of development.
Whilst the opening of these primary cares centres over recent years have placed additional pressure on the primary care operational cost base, these facilities form a key part of the infrastructure required to provide primary care services to an aging demographic and underpin the overall shift to primary care.
Health and Wellbeing Services
Health and wellbeing services, including the National Screening Service and environmental health service, support our whole population to stay healthy and well by focusing on prevention, protection, health promotion and improvement, reducing health inequalities, and protecting people from threats to their health and wellbeing.
The services within health and wellbeing support people and communities to protect and improve their health and wellbeing; turning research, evidence and knowledge into action; acting as the authority on health, wellbeing and policy development; building an intelligent health system and a healthier population.
The overall surplus reported in this division in 2019 has arisen mainly from a brought forward first surplus from 2018.
Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme The PCRS supports the delivery of a wide range of primary care services to the general public through primary care contractors like general practitioners (GPs), dentists, opticians or pharmacists for the free or reduced cost services they provide to the public across a range of community health schemes or arrangements.
The schemes are operated by PCRS on the basis of legislation and/or government policy.
Mental health services reported a minor deficit in 2019 arising from a high level of reliance on agency and overtime due to a difficulty in recruiting staff as well as an increasing level of high cost residential placements with external private providers.
The level of expenditure on external high costs residential placements is growing year on year due to the increasing complexity of patient’s needs, along with our own capacity and staffing constraints.
The Finance Reform Programme continues to support the progression of the one of the key non-clinical strategic priorities of the HSE, namely to implement a single modern integrated financial management and procurement system (IFMS) across the Irish health service.
This system, along with the standard national processes it will support, aims to change how Finance operates in the health service.
It will enable our finance teams to better support our services in operating within their available resources while also enhancing their ability to deliver and demonstrate value for patients.
During 2019, work continued on the process designs, chart of accounts and enterprise structure in respect of the IFMS project.
The HSE concluded the successful procurement of an external systems implementation support partner in 2019.
Preparation for the national design and build stage commenced in December 2019.
Activity Based Funding
The HSE continued to progress the embedding of activity based funding (ABF) in 2019.
This form of funding is in place to varying extents in a number of HSE service areas including Primary Care Reimbursement Service, NHSS and acute hospitals.
Additionally, as part of the Sláintecare plan, the HSE has prepared a 3 year ABF development plan which has been submitted to the DoH for its consideration and approval prior to publication.
The HSE has clearly flagged that it will not be possible to deliver on many of the savings measures set out in NSP 2020 due to the need to apply resources to the COVID-19 response as it continues to develop along with the requirement to maintain all existing capacity and open additional capacity as part of that response.
The HSE’s Department of Public Health Officials who play a very significant role in supporting the HSE in the management of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic report to the Chief Clinical Officer (CCO) and their costs are reported in corporate support services.
The HSE acknowledges that the on-going COVID-19 measures have placed significant additional pressure on many of our staff, particularly our front line and clinical staff who are giving their all and who have our utmost respect and appreciation.
During 2019, there were two distinct governance arrangements in place within the HSE.
During the period 01 January to 27 June the Health Service Executive (HSE) Directorate was the governing body of the HSE under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, with the Director General accountable to the Minister for Health.
Since 28 June the Board is the governing body of the HSE and is accountable to the Minister for Health for the performance of its functions.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is in turn accountable to the Board and is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE.
The HSE exercises a wide range of statutory functions which may have significant implications both for individuals and for the public generally.
Under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019, the Minister for Health can issue directions to the HSE on the implementation of Ministerial and government policies and objectives and determine priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its Service Plan.
The HSE must comply with directions issued by the Minister for Health.
In line with the implementation of the recommendations of Sláintecare with regard to governance, the establishment of an independent Board was an important step in modernising and strengthening governance arrangements and sustaining reform.
The Board is responsible for holding the CEO and senior management to account for the effective performance of their responsibilities.
It is the responsibility of the CEO and his senior management team to ensure that the Board is provided with all the necessary information to enable it to perform its functions.
The CEO must also provide assurance to the Board that the functions which it has delegated to him are being appropriately discharged.
(i) to achieve the HSE’s objectives
(ii) for the internal performance and accountability in respect of the HSE’s:
Developing a plan for building public trust and confidence in the HSE and the wider health service.
Ensuring the HSE’s full support for and implementation of the Government’s programme of health reform as set out in the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy.
For 2019, exercising effective budgetary management, including improving the value achieved with existing resources and securing target saving, with the objective of delivering the National Service Plan within Budget.
It is required to satisfy itself that appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place

Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee is established and maintained in accordance with Section 40H of the Health Act 2004 as amended by Section 23 of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019.
The legislation also recognises that the Audit Committee has a role to provide oversight and advice on risk management.
Therefore, its title has been expanded to the ‘Audit and Risk Committee’ to reflect the full nature of its remit.
Legislation obliges membership of the Committee to comprise no fewer than three Board members and not fewer than four other persons who, in the opinion of the Board, have the relevant skills and experience to perform the functions of the committee, at least one of whom shall hold a professional qualification in accountancy or auditing.
Under current legislation the Committee is required to: •
Advise the Board and the CEO on financial matters relating to its function
Report in writing at least once in every year to the Board and CEO on those matters and on the activities of the Committee in the previous year and provide a copy of that report to the Minister.
The functions of the Audit and Risk Committee include a range of financial, statutory, compliance and governance matters as set out in legislation.
In support of its statutory remit, the Committee has established terms of reference approved by the Board.
These provide for the Committee’s role to extend to the following areas: •
Advising the Board and the CEO on financial matters and carrying out related reporting activities, including compliance reporting to the Board and the Minister for Health as required
Reviewing the appropriateness of HSE’s accounting policies, annual financial statements, annual report and required corporate governance assurances and any matters and advice relating to making a satisfactory recommendation of same to the Board
Financial Governance
• Risk Committee Chairperson – Rate per meeting €402.39 to a maximum of €2,414 per annum
The CEO is required to ensure that the Audit and Risk Committee is provided with all the Executive’s audit reports, audit plans and monthly reports on expenditure, and if he has reason to suspect that any material misappropriation of the Executive’s money, or any fraudulent conversion or misapplication of the Executive’s property, may have taken place, report that matter to the Audit and Risk Committee as soon as practicable.
In addition, the CEO provides to the Audit and Risk Committee information on any financial matter or procedure necessary for the performance of its functions by the committee when requested to do so by the Audit and Risk Committee and where such information relates to:
a. Any contract that the Executive proposes to enter into involving expenditure of an amount in excess of a threshold specified by the committee, and
b. Any legal proceedings taken or threatened against the Executive that may give rise to potential financial liability.
In order to provide for the maximum continuity between the two Committees, the Chairperson of the previous Committee remained in place until the end of December 2019.
In addition, another member of the previous Audit Committee was joined by two members of the old Risk Committee on the new Audit and Risk Committee as well as one additional external member.
The Audit and Risk Committee has agreed a detailed workplan to cover 2020 which seeks to address in a systematic and comprehensive manner the key roles and responsibilities of the committee.
In preparing its initial workplan for 2019 and subsequently for 2020, the Committee took account of the workplans of both the previous Audit Committee and the previous Risk Committee where relevant and incorporated elements into new workplans.
The CEO has assigned the following members of the HSE Senior Management Team to attend meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Chief Financial Officer, the National Director of Internal Audit and the National Director of Quality Assurance and Verification.

Statement on Internal Control
1. Responsibility for the System of Internal Control
On behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE) I acknowledge the Board’s responsibility for ensuring that an effective system of internal control is maintained and operated.
This statement has been prepared in accordance with the requirement set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform’s (DPER’s) Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2016).
The Health Act 2004 as amended by the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 made provision for the establishment of a board (the “Board”), which is the HSE’s governing body, with authority, in the name of the HSE, to perform its functions.
The Board is accountable to the Minister for Health for the performance of its functions.
The amended 2004 Act also provides for a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is accountable to the Board.
The Board must satisfy itself that appropriate systems of internal control are in place.
The Board is required to review the controls and procedures adopted by the HSE in order to provide itself with reasonable assurance that they are adequate to secure compliance by the HSE with its statutory and governance obligations.
The Board is also responsible for strengthening governance, oversight and performance.
The Board members have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the functions of the HSE to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the effective and efficient performance of those functions.
The amended 2004 Act also provides for the establishment of an Audit and Risk Committee and such other committees or sub-committees that the Board deem necessary to assist it in the performance of its functions.
The Board has established four committees to provide more detailed oversight of specific areas as defined in the respective committee’s terms of reference.
These committees are:
2. Purpose of the System of Internal Control
The system of internal control is designed to manage and reduce risk rather than to eliminate risk and as such the review of the system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance of effectiveness.
The system of internal control seeks to ensure that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or detected in a timely manner.
3. Capacity to Handle Risk
The Board, as the governing body of the HSE, has overall responsibility for the system of internal control and risk management.
The Board may establish committees to provide assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its duties and functions.
The Audit and Risk Committee, was established on 26 July 2019 in accordance with the provisions of the 2019 Act.
This Audit and Risk Committee replaced the previous Audit Committee and Risk Committee which were previously established in 2014 in accordance with the provisions of the Health Service (Governance) Act 2013.
The membership of the Audit and Risk Committee consists of an independent external Chairperson, three other external members and four members of the Board.
All members have the relevant skills and experience to perform the functions of the Committee including highly experienced and qualified finance professionals. • the Audit and Risk Committee •
the Performance and Delivery Committee Among its responsibilities the Audit and Risk Committee is required: •
the People and Culture Committee. to advise the Board and the CEO on financial matters relating to their respective functions and a number of compliance matters related to same
to provide advice to the Board and the CEO on the regularity and propriety of transactions recorded in the accounts and on the effectiveness of the system of internal control operated by the HSE
to provide oversight and advice with regard to the operation of the HSE Risk Management framework and related activities
to provide oversight and advice in relation to the HSE Internal Audit Function.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Financial Governance
The Audit and Risk Committee operates under an agreed Charter which sets out in detail the role, duties and authority of the Committee.
The Audit and Risk Committee is required to meet at least four times annually.
In 2019 the Audit and Risk Committee met on six occasions since its appointment in June.
The previous Audit Committee met on four occasions and the previous Risk Committee met on three occasions with a joint meeting of the Audit and Risk Committees on one further occasion.
The HSE has an Internal Audit function with appropriately trained personnel operating in accordance with a written charter approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The National Director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit and Risk Committee and to the CEO and is a member of the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT).
The work programme of Internal Audit is agreed and monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The HSE’s Internal Audit function is responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive programme of audit work is carried out continually throughout the HSE.
The purpose of this work is to provide assurance that controls and procedures are operated in accordance with best practise and with the appropriate regulations and to make recommendations for the improvement of such controls and procedures.
The scope of the Internal Audit function covers all systems and activities throughout the HSE including bodies funded by the HSE.
During 2019 Internal Audit completed a substantial body of work as part of its annual risk based work plan, issuing 164 audit reports, containing 1,159 recommendations, in relation to HSE and its funded agencies.
Particular focus was placed on auditing funded agencies as well as ICT audits.
The findings of these reports were considered by the HSE Audit and Risk Committee and EMT.
Based on the work of Internal Audit and the results of the individual internal audit engagements, the 2019 Annual Report of the National Director of Internal Audit provided an overall audit opinion that limited assurance can be provided in respect of governance, risk management and financial control processes.
The Internal Audit opinion is based on the following three possible ratings and their definitions:
Type of Overall Opinion Rating
1. Adequate
Definition
The system of governance, risk management and control has substantial weaknesses that need to be addressed urgently.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 The HSE has developed an integrated risk management policy which clearly defines the roles and responsibilities for all levels of staff in relation to risk (financial and non-financial).
The policy is communicated across all levels of staff.
The HSE is committed to ensuring that risk management is seen as the concern of everyone, is embedded as part of normal day to day business and informs the strategic and operational planning and performance cycle.
Management at all levels of the HSE are responsible to the CEO for the implementation and maintenance of appropriate and effective internal control in respect of their respective functions and organisations.
This embedding of responsibility for the system of internal control is designed to ensure not only that the HSE is capable of detecting and responding to control issues should they arise, with appropriate escalation protocols, but also that a culture of accountability and responsibility pertains throughout the whole organisation.
Informed by the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme (Scally Report) the EMT commissioned a Risk Management Working Team to prepare proposals in relation to risk management in the HSE.
This working group was comprised of key senior HSE management representing all National service areas, Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups.
It was sponsored by the National Director, Quality Assurance and Verification and was supported by external risk management experts.
This review was completed in 2019 and the review report and recommendations were accepted by the Board in September 2019.
The recommendations of the Review include the need for the HSE to: •
Adopt an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach
Establish an ERM Programme
Appoint a dedicated Chief Risk Officer.
The Code of Governance reflects the current behavioural standards, policies and procedures to be applied within and by the HSE, and the agencies it funds, to provide services on its behalf
The Performance and Accountability Framework describes in detail the means by which managers in the health service, including those in CHOs and Hospital Groups will be held to account for performance in relation to service provision, quality and patient safety, finance and workforce
There is a framework of administrative procedures in place including segregation of duties, a system of delegation and accountability, a system for the authorisation of expenditure and regular management reporting
The HSE’s National Financial Regulations form an integral part of the system of internal control and have been designed to be consistent with statutory requirements and to also ensure compliance with public sector guidelines issued by DPER
The HSE has in place a devolved annual budgetary system and each year the Minister for Health formally approves the annual National Service Plan.
Defined accountability limits are set which are closely monitored by the National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) on behalf of the CEO
The HSE has in place a wide range of written policies, procedures, protocols and guidelines in relation to operational and financial controls
The HSE carries out an annual comprehensive review of the system of internal control, details of which are covered in a later section of this report
There are systems and controls aimed at ensuring the security of the information and communication technology systems within the HSE.
This is an area of high priority for the HSE given the challenges of managing multiple systems across the entire HSE.
Implementation of the recommendations of this working group will be progressed in 2020.
The HSE has an established Healthcare Audit function which forms a key part of Quality Assurance and Verification.
The Healthcare Audit Team consists of appropriately trained personnel.
The purpose of this team is to provide assurance that controls and procedures related to the delivery of healthcare are operated in accordance with best practise and with the appropriate regulations and to make recommendations for the improvement of such controls and procedures.
Risk registers are in place at key levels in the organisation.
Risks on these registers have been assessed and evaluated according to their significance.
At an organisational level the Corporate Risk Register is subject to monitoring and updating on a quarterly basis.
The risk registers set out the existing controls, the risk rating and any additional controls required to mitigate each risk, and assigns both persons and timescales for completion of these.
An aspect of the quarterly monitoring process is to monitor the completion of additional controls required and to re-evaluate the risk based on this.
At the end of 2019 the EMT undertook a major revision of the Corporate Risk Register.
This was approved in February 2020.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Financial Governance
Additionally an annual Controls Assurance Statement (CAS) must be completed by all senior management at Grade VIII and above.
This statement requires management to confirm that they are aware of and comply with the key controls and the code of governance in place within the HSE.
5. Procurement
The HSE has procedures and policies in place to ensure compliance with current procurement rules and guidelines.
In procuring goods and services, all areas within the HSE must comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE’s National Financial Regulations.
Matters arising regarding controls over procurement are highlighted under heading 8 Internal Control Issues.
6. On-going Monitoring and Review
Formal procedures have been established for monitoring control processes and control deficiencies and are communicated to those responsible for taking corrective action and to the Board and senior management.
I confirm that the HSE conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the Internal Controls for 2019 which took into consideration: •
Audit and Risk Committee minutes/reports
Findings, recommendations and Audit Opinions from internal audit reports
Annual Report of the National Director of Internal Audit
Findings arising from the Internal Control Questionnaire
Status of the recommendations of previous years’ reports on the Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control
Recommendations from management letters of the C&AG
The 2019 audit programme of the C&AG and in particular, the audit risks identified therein
Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts
Board and EMT minutes
Minutes of steering group/working group/implementation groups etc.
External reviews undertaken by the HSE to assist in identifying financial control issues and implementing revised policies and business processes
HSE Corporate Risk Register quarterly review process
Findings arising from the compliance monitoring arrangements with Section 38 and Section 39 agencies
Feedback from the HSE’s Healthcare Audit function.
The HSE has engaged an independent audit firm through a competitive process who have conducted a review of circa 6.5% of ICQ participants to validate the integrity of the responses.
The report on the review of the system of internal control will be considered by the Audit and Risk Committee, the CEO and EMT and by the Board of the HSE.
The results of the review indicate there is evidence that: •
The HSE has adopted a suite of internal policies and procedures, which form the basis of the internal control framework
Where high level risks have been identified, mitigating/ compensating controls are generally in place
Instances of non-compliance which may expose the HSE to material risk have been identified during this review process.
However, there is evidence that in general there is a programme of activity or plans in development to improve the controls environment
Awareness of the requirement for internal controls and accountability has increased during 2019 with a continued increase in the number of staff who completed the ICQ survey increasing significantly by a further 9%.
Analysis indicates that most managers have a very high understanding and awareness of their responsibility in respect to internal controls.
While this analysis indicates that most managers are reporting strong levels of compliance with internal controls there is still evidence of some continued lack of uniform consistency of responses in 2019 which indicates that further efforts are required in 2020 to improve understanding and compliance with internal controls.
Financial Governance
A significant enabler of the IFMS project is the development of a Financial Management Framework which defines the process, governance and controls required to demonstrate effective financial management practice across the health system. The Framework is a living document which has most recently been approved by the Finance Reform Programme (FRP) Steering Committee in June 2019.
Following a properly procured public tender process SAP was selected as the software platform for IFMS in June 2017.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
ii. Compliance with Procurement Rules Financial Governance
The HSE incurs expenditure of approximately €2.7bn annually in relation to goods and services subject to procurement regulations that are set out in detail in the HSE’s National Financial Regulations and underpinned by EU Directive 2014/24 and Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.
In line with the revised code of practice for the governance of state bodies, and the public procurement policy framework, the HSE is required to ensure that all contracts that are for a value of €25k or above, are secured competitively in line with public procurement requirements and to report the levels of non-compliance identified.
The findings of the review of the internal control system indicates that compliance with procurement regulations remains an issue for the HSE, in particular in relation to lack of compliance with: •
Requirements to procure and source from valid contracts already in place
Requirements for market testing, tendering and utilising competitive processes
Requirements to report non-compliance as per DPER code and circulars.
Supporting Infrastructure •
Assignment of responsibility for overseeing and managing related IT developments to an Assistant National Director in HBS Procurement.
Enhanced stock control through on going roll-out of the National Distribution Centre (NDC) and roll out of Point of Use System (POS) stock management system in the CHOs and Hospital Groups.
Continuing development of the Pricing and Assisted Sourcing System (PASS) which will continue to assist HSE staff by improving access and visibility of current contracts.
Finalisation of a three-year Compliance Improvement Plan 2017-2020 in Q4 2016, which addresses identified non-compliance issues.
Currently, a compliance improvement programme is being implemented in a systematic manner across selected CHOs and Hospital Groups working in conjunction with HBS Procurement.
Development of an online procurement compliance report which provides detail of non-compliance to Service areas.
This report is currently in use but is not yet fully populated for the entire HSE area.
Once fully developed this report will be used to both identify non-compliance and as a benchmark monitoring tool as part of the Compliance Improvement Plan roll-out.
Development of a digital Corporate Procurement Planning (CPP) toolset which will be available to each CHO and Hospital Group.
This online tool is expected to provide bespoke analysis and information such as procurement activity, expenditure which is greater than €25K, compliance levels and savings.
The HSE cannot provide a definitive rate of procurement non-compliance.
However the HSE expects to be in a position to provide this in respect of 2020.
The HSE procurement team tasked with providing this analysis is currently re-deployed to on-going COVID-19 priority workstreams.
Management and Internal Audit’s monitoring of non-compliance indicates that compliance with procurement regulations remains an issue for the HSE.
The HSE is continuing to progress a programme of reform of its procurement function to improve compliance with public procurement regulations and to increase the usage of contracts awarded by the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).
In the context of the HSE’s current procurement systems and lack of IFMS it is acknowledged that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.
The HSE has continued to progress a number of initiatives in 2019, organised around three key themes: Sourcing
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
I confirm that the following on-going monitoring systems are in place: •
Key risks and related controls have been identified and there is a process in place to monitor the operation of these controls
Reporting arrangements have been established at all levels where responsibility for financial management has been assigned
There are regular reviews by senior management of periodic and annual performance and financial reports indicating HSE performance against budgets/forecasts
There are regular reviews by the Department of Health of the HSE’s performance in terms of budget and service plans as well as including other key non-financial reporting such as workforce planning • The CEO and EMT meet as part of normal business at least twice monthly •
The work of Internal Audit forms an important part of the monitoring of the internal control system within the HSE.
The annual work plan of Internal Audit is informed by analysis of the key risks to which the HSE is exposed and is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The National Director of Internal Audit attends all Audit and Risk Committee meetings and has regular one to one meetings with the Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee as well as the CEO. Monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the HSE’s internal controls is also informed by the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG).
7. Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control I confirm that the HSE has procedures to monitor the effectiveness of its risk management and control procedures.
Additionally the IFMS project will include state of the art procurement functionality.
Key procurement business processes have been mapped and these will be used to assist in the design of improved lean business processes.
This will result in improved compliance but will take a number of years to progress.
Governance of Grants to Outside Agencies In 2019, circa €4.7 billion of the HSE’s total expenditure related to grants to outside agencies.
The legal framework under which the HSE provides grant funding to agencies is set out in the Health Act 2004.
Annually the HSE funds in excess of 2,000 agencies, ranging from the large voluntary hospitals in receipt of over €300m to small community based agencies in receipt of €500. •
At the end of 2019, 91% (2018: 95%) of funding was covered by a completed SA/GA. Reports in this regard are circulated on a monthly basis to the service areas, CHOs and the Hospital Groups for their necessary attention.
Briefing sessions on the Governance Framework for both HSE and agency staff were held in all CHOs in November and December 2019.
These briefing sessions focused on the key fundamentals of the Governance Framework and in particular the requirement to have SAs and GAs completed by the end of February 2020.
Annual Compliance Statements are required from all S38 agencies (circa 74% of total funding) and S39 agencies in receipt of over €3 million (circa 14% of total funding). These agencies self-certify annually in respect of the governance procedures in place at Board and Executive level within their own organisation.
The ACS process informs the HSE of any gaps in compliance which then allows the HSE to ensure that required improvements are considered.
Annual Financial Monitoring Returns (AFMR) and Annual Financial Statements (AFS) are required to be received, recorded and reviewed by the CHO and HG staff.
The Service Provider Governance (SPG) online system was further developed to enable the recording of the AFMRs and AFS reviews.
Reports are produced from the SPG system and circulated to the CHOs and Hospital Groups.
This allows for the timely monitoring of the receipt and review of the AFS and AFMR.
The HSE is establishing Contract Management Support Units (CMSUs) in each of the nine CHOs.
The CMSUs will be a key resource within the CHOs in terms of enhancing the level of management and oversight in respect of S38 and S39 agencies funded by the CHOs.
Four pilot sites are currently being put in place in CHOs 4, 6, 7 and 9.
In addition CHOs 3, 5 and 8 are in the very early stages of design and development of their CMSUs.
Currently an implementation group is working with representatives from these CHOs to develop appropriate CMSU processes.
Among the key responsibilities for the CMSU will be to ensure that:
Before entering into any funding arrangement the HSE determines the maximum amount of funding that it proposes to make available along with the level of service to be provided for that funding.
For the larger agencies, cash is disbursed by the HSE’s Treasury unit based on agreed cash profiles.
The system of internal control operating in individual funded agencies is subject to review on a sample basis by Internal Audit.
The requirement to submit financial reports and staffing returns and to hold monitoring meetings is dependent on the size of the agency.
During 2019, there were weaknesses identified by the HSE’s annual internal control review, via the Controls Assurance Review process, and Internal Audit reports particularly in the application of processes relating to monitoring and oversight of some agencies.
The HSE has two types of contractual agreements with these agencies that are, in the main, tailored to reflect the level of funding in place.
Service Arrangement (SA), health agencies in receipt of funding in excess of €250,000
Grant Aid Agreement (GA), health agencies in receipt of funding of less than €250,000.
External and internal audits have found that: •
Monitoring meetings may not have been conducted at the frequency required in accordance with the HSE guidelines
There was a lack of evidence of the review of required financial performance data, such as management accounts and activity data
Contractual agreements relating to the provision of funding include a requirement for grantees to have appropriate risk management and governance arrangements in place and to comply with public procurement guidelines and public sector pay policy.
Audits and Annual Compliance Statement (ACS) submissions indicate some gaps in governance arrangements, compliance in some incidents with legacy issues regarding public sector pay policy and, in particular, procurement remains an issue.
The steps being taken by the HSE in recent years to address the weaknesses identified are set out below.
These initiatives have enabled the HSE, to a reasonable extent, to be satisfied that there are appropriate governance structures and procedures in place with these agencies.
AFS and AFMR of the relevant agencies are received and reviewed
Key documentation such as Business plans, Chairpersons’ statements, Management accounts, evidence of Monitoring Review Meetings along with other key activity data are received and reviewed as required.
Financial Governance
The HSE’s governance framework is consistent with the management and accountability arrangements for grants from Exchequer funding as set out in the instruction issued by DPER in September 2014, with one sanctioned exception in respect of prefunding arrangements.
The HSE’s Compliance Unit will continue to act in an advisory and support role during the implementation of this initiative.
In 2016, the HSE commenced an External Review of Governance at Board and Executive level in certain S38 agencies.
Currently 28 of these reviews have been completed and the remaining two are nearing completion.
Chairpersons of the Boards of each of these agencies have received either a final report or a draft report to consider.
The follow up process requires the HSE to
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Financial Governance
engage with the Chairpersons of the relevant Boards of the agencies to receive an update on progress plans with a further quarterly follow up process with the Agencies and the senior management staff in the CHOs and Hospital Groups.
A procurement process for a rolling review programme has commenced.
This rolling review programme is expected to include a number of S39 as well as the S38 agencies.
These reviews would expect to draw from and build upon the work being completed in the current external review process.
A five year cycle is envisaged with eight agencies being reviewed annually.
Some of the larger S38 and S39 agencies have themselves used the outputs of the Annual Compliance Statement, Annual Financial Monitoring Return and the external reviews, to implement their own initiatives to enhance their Governance at Board level.
Specifically this has had some positive impacts in key areas such as: –
Development of internal audit function
Rotation of Boards
Board Committee Structure
Development of Codes of Conduct.
In relation to the weaknesses identified in the area of procurement regarding S38 and S39 agencies, HBS continues to work with and provide on-going support to these agencies.
All agencies receiving annual funding in excess of €150k have been provided with online access to the HBS Pricing and Assisted Sourcing System (PASS).
This provides access for these agencies to the HBS/OGP contracts and Framework Agreements.
A Corporate Procurement Plan Guidance for Health Agencies has been communicated along with training by HBS Procurement.
On-going review of audit findings relating to the governance of grants to outside agencies is a priority for the HSE and there are established processes in place for following up on internal audit as well as external audit findings (local management and national management letters).
iv. Information Communication Technology (ICT)
The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OoCIO) delivers and manages a full range of ICT services throughout the HSE and in part of the voluntary acute sector.
The HSE have a base of over 50,000 users using approximately 1,817 applications and over 1,000 networked sites.
In addition, the OoCIO provide a range of national applications to the acute voluntary sector and indirectly supports their user base.
There are approximately 266 ICT projects currently being progressed, of which about 50 are large multi-annual programmes or projects.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
The OoCIO is committed to improving controls in respect of cyber security.
The OoCIO has a number of programmes underway to manage these weaknesses across our large domain.
These include Windows 7 refresh programme, the single sign-on programme, other key infrastructure upgrades, and the upgrading of application software which will, over time, provide a means for the following: •
Single logon to domains and applications which ensures that all staff have unique and safe access to the domains and applications
Single email platform to improve cross regional communication and collaboration
Upgraded infrastructure with modern security features
Upgraded applications and database technology.
Migration to a single digital identity for staff has commenced and will continue to be rolled out during 2020/2021 across CHOs, Hospital Groups and HBS, as well as central functions.
The OoCIO also has plans to improve resourcing to ensure that staff with the right blend of technology skills, are situated where needed most.
A formal review of ICT policies was launched in January 2020 by the CIO, as part of normal operations within OoCIO this will be complete during Q3 of 2020.
Following this review and the likely updating of some policies, OoCIO management intends to conduct a compliance exercise to assess and baseline the level of compliance with these policies.
This compliance assessment will inform what further actions then need to be taken.
OoCIO management has initiated an Infrastructure Migration Programme which will migrate selected disaster recovery environments to the cloud.
The initial stages of this programme will in turn inform a cloud services procurement to be commenced later this year.
That procurement will include provision for disaster recoveries for all systems.
Further, the Internal Audit function in collaboration with external specialist ICT audit support will continue to conduct targeted audits on a risk management basis.
v. Risk Management
As detailed in section 3 the HSE recognises the importance of a strong Risk Management Framework.
The recommendations of the Risk Management Review were approved by the Board in September 2019.
Implementation of these recommendations will be progressed during 2020.
The HSE acknowledges that the current and on-going COVID-19 pandemic poses a risk that the management actions identified in this section could be delayed due to the prioritisation of COVID-19 measures.
The HSE’s priority at this time is to safeguard the people of Ireland that it serves and to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
However, the HSE considers that the system of internal control is also a priority.
9. Conclusion
Financial Governance The report on the Review of Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control in the HSE has been considered by the HSE’s Audit and Risk Committee who have provided advice on same on behalf of the Board.
The HSE is an organisation undergoing significant change as well as facing a significant challenge in terms of its response to the current COVID-19 pandemic emergency facing the country.
The HSE’s control systems still rely on the legacy financial systems of the former health bodies it replaced.
These legacy systems will be replaced on a phased basis with a single national integrated financial and procurement system as detailed earlier in section 8.
The review of the system of internal control indicates that there are limitations and weaknesses observed in the HSE’s system of internal controls.
However where these weaknesses have been observed there is some evidence of mitigation and/or management action plans that have been undertaken to reduce the risk exposure, sufficient to support the adoption of the Annual Financial Statements.
However, these weaknesses taken in conjunction with the overall 2019 limited audit opinion issued by the National Director of Internal Audit mean that the review can only provide limited assurance in respect of the system of internal control.
The HSE acknowledges that there is a requirement to improve overall levels of compliance with the system of internal control, and this is receiving senior management attention, however, it is encouraging to note that the 2019 review indicates a continued growing awareness of the importance of improved accountability and responsibility at all levels of HSE staff, and stronger engagement with the controls assurance process for 2019.
The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for the system of internal control within the HSE and will continue to monitor and support further development of controls.
Progress will be reassessed in the 2020 Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control.

Comptroller and Auditor General Report For presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas Financial Governance
Health Service Executive
Opinion on the financial statements I have audited the financial statements of the Health Service Executive for the year ended 31 December 2019 as required under the provisions of Section 36 of the Health Act 2004.
The financial statements comprise •
the statement of revenue income and expenditure
the statement of capital income and expenditure
the statement of financial position
the statement of changes in reserves
the statement of cash flows and
the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In my opinion, the financial statements •
have been properly prepared in accordance with the accounting standards specified by the Minister for Health as set out in the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies.
Report on information other than the financial statements, and on other matters The Health Service Executive has presented certain other information together with the financial statements.
This comprises the annual report including the governance statement and Board members’ report, and the statement on internal control.
My responsibilities to report in relation to such information, and on certain other matters upon which I report by exception, are described in the appendix to this report.
Procurement non-compliance
The statement on internal control discloses that compliance with procurement regulations remains an issue for the Health Service Executive, but that it is not yet in a position to quantify the value of its expenditure on goods and services where the procedures employed did not comply with procurement guidelines.
The statement on internal control sets out the steps being taken by the Health Service Executive to address its non-compliance with procurement rules, but it acknowledges that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.
Basis of the opinion
I conducted my audit of the financial statements in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as promulgated by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions.
My responsibilities under those standards are described in the appendix to this report.
I am independent of the Health Service Executive and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the standards.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
Comptroller and Auditor General 14 May 2020
Appendix to the report
The members are responsible for •
the preparation of financial statements in the form prescribed under Section 36 of the Health Act 2004 and accounting standards specified by the Minister for Health
ensuring the regularity of transactions
assessing whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General
I am required under Section 36 of the Health Act 2004 to audit the financial statements of the Health Service Executive and to report thereon to the Houses of the Oireachtas.
My objective in carrying out the audit is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
In doing so, •
I identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
I obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls.
I evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures.
Financial Governance
Responsibilities of Board members
I conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, on whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Health Service Executive’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.
My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Health Service Executive to cease to continue as a going concern.
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information presented with those statements, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, I am required under the ISAs to read the other information presented and, in doing so, consider whether thwe other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with knowledge obtained during the audit, or if it otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.
Reporting on other matters
My audit is conducted by reference to the special considerations which attach to State bodies in receipt of substantial funding from the State in relation to their management and operation.
I report if I identify material matters relating to the manner in which public business has been conducted.
I seek to obtain evidence about the regularity of financial transactions in the course of audit.
I report if I identify any material instance where public money has not been applied for the purposes intended or where transactions did not conform to the authorities governing them.
I also report by exception if, in my opinion, •
I have not received all the information and explanations I required for my audit, or
the accounting records were not sufficient to permit the financial statements to be readily and properly audited, or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records.

Pay costs for employees in the voluntary sector are accounted for under Non-Pay Expenditure (Revenue Grants to Outside Agencies).
See Note 8 and Appendix 1.
Superannuation
Eligible staff employed in the HSE are members of a variety of defined benefit superannuation schemes.
Superannuation entitlements (i.e. pensions) of retired staff are paid out of current income and are charged to income and expenditure in the year in which they become payable.
In accordance with a Directive from the Minister for Health, no provision is made in the financial statements in respect of future pension benefits and no charge is made to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure in respect of this.
Superannuation contributions from employees who are members of these schemes are credited to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure when received.
No formal actuarial valuations of the HSE’s pension liabilities are carried out.
The Pension charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure for 2019 was €747m (2018: €728m), which included payments in respect of once-off lump sums and gratuity payments on retirement of €112m (2018: €128m).

Note 9 The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 Financial Governance
The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides the legislative basis for the repayment of what has been referred to as ‘long stay charges’, which were incorrectly levied on persons with full medical card eligibility prior to 14 July 2005.
The scheme allows for the repayment of charges to the following people: •
Living people who were wrongly charged at any time since 1976
The estates of people who were wrongly charged and died on or after 9 December 1998
A special account was set up which is funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas and from which repayments are made.
An amount of €2m was set aside in 2019 for this purpose.
The majority of this funding refers to a provision for payments that will arise as a result of follow-on claims and offer acceptances.
The scheme closed to new applicants on 31 December 2007 and nearly 14,000 claims have been received in respect of living patients and nearly 27,000 claims in respect of estates.
Up to 31 December 2019, 20,300 claims were paid.
As at December 2019, there were no outstanding claims being processed to offer stage under the scheme.
€0.5m has been provided in the HSE’s 2020 budget to fund repayments for outstanding claims and associated administrative costs.
The cumulative total expenditure of the scheme (including administrative costs) to 31 December 2019 is €485.82m.

Note 10 The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006
The overall cost over the lifetime of the scheme was originally estimated at €90m.
The cumulative expenditure on the insurance scheme to 31 December 2019 was €11m.
Financial Governance
The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006 established a statutory scheme to address insurance difficulties experienced by persons infected with Hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of blood and blood products.
This scheme addresses the problems faced by these persons due to their inability to purchase mortgage protection and life assurance policies as a result of contaminated blood products being administered to them.
The scheme covers the insurance risk for the 1,700 or more people entitled to avail of assurance products, regardless of any other medical conditions these people may have, once they pay the standard premium that an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay.
The life assurance element of the scheme was launched by the HSE in September 2007.
A further element, providing for travel insurance cover, was introduced in March 2009.
In 2019, the following expenditure has been charged to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure in respect of the Insurance Scheme: 2019 €’000

Note 11 State Claims Agency Since 1 July 2009, the HSE is funded for claims processed by the State Claims Agency under the terms of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.
From 1 January 2010, the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Functions) Order 2009 extended the State indemnity to personal injury and third party property damage claims against the HSE.
Awards paid to claimants under the terms of the scheme are accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The State Claims Agency’s best current estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving each claim, includes all foreseeable costs such as settlement amounts, plaintiff legal costs and defence costs such as fees payable to counsel, consultants etc.
In 2019, the charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure was €390.94m (2018: €318.69m).
Based on actuarial estimates, the charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure is expected to increase significantly in future years.
In accordance with the directions of the Minister for Health, no provision has been made for this liability in the financial statements.
The estimated liability is revised on a regular basis in light of any new information received for example past trends in settlement amounts and legal costs.
At 31 December 2019, the estimated liability incurred to that date under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme and State indemnity was €3,302m (2018 €2,792m).
Of this €3,302m, approximately €2,722m relates to active claims in respect of clinical care, with the balance of the estimated liability relating to non-clinical care claims.
Active claims are those that have been notified to the State Claims Agency through legal process and that have not yet concluded as at the reporting date.

Note 12 Long-Term Residential Care (incorporating Nursing Homes Support Scheme/Fair Deal) The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal) commenced in 2009 and phases out the former Nursing Homes Subvention Scheme and the ‘contract beds’ system for older persons.
Under the scheme, people who need long-term residential care services have their income and assets assessed, and then contribute up to 80% of assessable income and up to 7.5% per annum of the value of the assets they own, subject to a maximum period of three years in respect of their principal private residence, towards the cost of their care.
The HSE pays the balance, if any, of the costs of their care in both registered public and private nursing homes covered under the scheme.

NHSS recipient contributions for those patients in voluntary centres (S38 Organisations) amounted to €6.86m (2018: €6.67m), and is retained by those centres and does not constitute income for the HSE.
Additional Income
Under Section 27 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, a Schedule of Assets must be submitted to the HSE in respect of a deceased person who received financial support under the Scheme.
This is checked to identify and calculate any overpayment of financial support that is repayable to the HSE pursuant to Section 42 of the Act.
The HSE collected income of €7.61m during 2019 (2018 : €6.58m) in respect of non-declared income and assets of Fair Deal clients.
Contract beds and Subvention beds In 2019, payments of €15.9m (2018: €20.1m) were made in relation to contract beds and nursing home subvention.
These schemes are being phased out having had no new entrants since the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009.
Expenditure within public facilities Within the public homes in 2019 there was an additional €26.57m (2018: €23.12m) of costs relating to long-term care.
These costs related to fixed unit costs and other costs incurred which were in excess of the reimbursed ‘money follows the patient’ rate paid under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Cost of Public Nursing Homes
In 2019, the cost of public nursing homes amounted to €359.73m (2018 €354.67m), these costs are gross and the client contribution element amounted to €63.07m (2018 €61.13m).
The contributions are recognised as income in Long Stay Charges in Statement of Income and Expenditure.

Ancillary State Support
The total gross amount of Ancillary State Support advised to Revenue as at 31 December 2019 for recoupment from the commencement of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (where a relevant and non-relevant event has occurred) was €160.74m, representing 7,483 client loans.
As at 31 December 2019 the Revenue Commissioners are collecting €160.12m, representing 7,497 clients.
The difference accounts for clients where their Nursing Home loan is not due for repayment such as the Further Deferral option, as mentioned above, and also clients who wish to make a voluntary repayment prior to a relevant event occurring.
The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that they had received €113.28m of loan repayments paid in full, representing 5,699 client loans.
Financial Governance
Ancillary State Support is an optional extra feature of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme for people who own property or assets in the State.
Instead of a person paying their assessed contribution for care from their own resources, a person can choose to apply for a Nursing Home Loan, to cover the portion of their contribution, which is based on property or land-based assets within the State.
The HSE then pays that portion of the cost of care on top of the State Support payment.
The loan is paid back to the State following the occurrence of a relevant event e.g. sale of the asset or death of the person.
Repayment of the loan is made to the Revenue Commissioners.
In certain cases, repayment of the loan can be deferred.
This part of the scheme is designed to protect people from having to sell their home during their lifetime.
The total amount of Nursing Home Loan payments made under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme that are outstanding (i.e. where a repayable amount has not been notified to Revenue for collection – a relevant event has not occurred), as at 31 December 2019 is €140.01m.
This amount does not include an adjustment for CPI as a relevant event has not yet occurred.

* Private Healthcare Insurance Income.
In line with the HSE's accounting policy the HSE recognises patient income due from private health insurance companies at the time the service is provided.
During 2017 some insurance companies commenced deductions from claims made by the HSE relating to the time period between the date of admission and the date the Private Insurance Patient form was signed by the patient.
The HSE has disputed these deductions through a legal process and it is expected that this dispute will be heard by the Courts sometime at the end of 2020 present COVID-19 environment allowing.
In line with the HSE's accounting policy a bad and doubtful debt provision is created in relation to debts outstanding for more than one year.
Primary utilisation of the properties can be analysed as follows: Delivery of health and personal social services Health Business Services and Support (including medical card processing etc.)
Total Properties
The 2018 figure has been revised as two properties had been classified as additional properties in error.
These were two new buildings completed in 2018 on existing HSE properties.
During the year there were 57 property additions to the healthcare estate and 31 properties were removed through both disposals and lease terminations.
The net result is an increase of 26 healthcare properties during 2019.
The total number of properties in the HSE healthcare estate at the end of 2019 has been impacted by a combination of routine estate management activities as well as the requirements of specific key healthcare strategies to deliver ongoing rollout of primary care centres and relocation of disability services to community settings.
Note 24 Taxation
The HSE carried out a significant self-review of tax compliance in respect of 2018 with external specialist tax assistance which was completed in 2019.
The self-review was conducted on an agreed risk based assessment across all tax heads for which the HSE needs to account.
The liability to taxes identified in the course of the self-review for 2018 was set out by means of a Self-Correction disclosure and payment (including interest) of €3,128,034 was made to the Revenue Commissioners in September 2019.
The amount represents 0.18% of the overall tax paid by the HSE for that year.
The HSE has a dedicated in house tax team resourced by tax professionals developing a strong relationship with Revenue and with access to external advisors where necessary.
The HSE remains committed to exemplary tax compliance.
Note 25 Contingent Liabilities
General
The HSE is involved in a number of claims involving legal proceedings which may generate liabilities, depending on the outcome of the litigation.
The HSE has insurance cover for professional indemnity, fire and specific all risk claims.
In most cases, such insurance would be sufficient to cover all costs, but this cannot be certain due to indemnity limits and certain policy conditions.
The financial effects of any uninsured contingencies have not been provided in the financial statements.
Patient Private Property Retained Interest Prior to 2005, interest income earned on patients’ private funds was retained by the former Health Boards and used to partially defray the costs incurred in administering approximately 19,000 Patients’ Private Property Accounts.
This action was based on previous legal advice.
Subsequent legal advice taken by the HSE indicated that the Patients’ Private Property Accounts operated under an implied trustee relationship with the patients and, as such, the HSE was obliged to remit interest earned to those patients.
The lack of available historic private patient property records limits the ability of the HSE to estimate the full potential liability and therefore a partial liability only has been provided for in the HSE's financial statements.
The HSE has set up a Steering Group to actively manage this issue to a satisfactory resolution.
Clinical Indemnity Scheme
Details of the contingent liability in respect of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme are set out in Note 11.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019
In June 2018, a settlement was agreed between the State and Medical Consultants arising from an alleged breach of contract in relation to the non-implementation of the 2008 Consultants contract.
The settlement specifies that 40% of the retrospective remuneration should be paid in 2019 and the balance in 2020.
The HSE’s estimate of the liability at 31 December 2018 was €198 million.
The total cost of the legal settlement is now estimated at €186m at 31 December 2019.
The amount paid in 2019 was €85m (Clinical Pay).
The estimated remaining liability due is 2020 is €101m.
Note 27 Post Balance Sheet Events
The unprecedented outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic presents significant global challenges and uncertainties in all sectors, but in particular on the Health Sector.
The HSE is tasked with the provision of health and personal social services for the citizens of Ireland and is therefore significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The HSE and its staff are playing a major role in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak and is actively taking steps to limit the spread of the outbreak and to ensure resources are available such that appropriate Hospital and Community services are in place to look after those whose health has become impacted by the virus.
There are increased pressures on services and resourcing which have resulted in the requirement for additional funding in 2020 to continue to react and manage the current outbreak.
The HSE has received contingency funding from the Department of Health as reflected in “Ireland’s National Action Plan Response to COVID-19” issued March 2020.
This commitment to additional funding means that the HSE considers that it is still appropriate to apply the going concern concept.
There is no impact on the financial statements of the HSE for 2019.
HSE management are fully aware of the potential additional risks due to the disruption of the normal activities of the HSE.
While it is not possible to determine all the likely impacts financial or otherwise due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, the HSE continues to monitor the situation and plan accordingly.
Note 28 Related Party Transactions In the normal course of business, the Health Service Executive may approve grants and may also enter into other contractual arrangements with undertakings in which Health Service Directorate members are employed or otherwise interested.
The Health Service Executive adopts procedures in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform’s Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, in relation to the disclosure of interests of Health Service Directorate members.
These procedures have been adhered to by the Directorate members and the HSE during the year.
During 2019, a member of staff on secondment to the HSE from a funded body served as a member of the Directorate.
No other member of the Directorate held an interest with any related parties.
From June 28 2019, a number of interests were noted by board members.
It was deemed that none of the interests disclosed have a material commercial and/or financial impact on the HSE.
It was also noted that no investments in unlisted companies, partnerships and other forms of business, major shareholdings and beneficial interests were disclosed.
No board members disclosed gifts or hospitality offered by external bodies in the last twelve months.
No board members noted any contractual relationship with the HSE and no board members noted any other conflicts not covered elsewhere.
Key Management Personnel
All Board members, in addition to the HSE’s Executive Management Team including the Chief Executive Officer, are considered to be key management of the HSE.
Overall remuneration in relation to serving key management personnel, including those that were appointed and resigned during the year, is €1.7m (2018: €1.1m).
The Board members are in receipt of fees and other than as disclosed in Note 2 all other key management’s remuneration comprise of basic pay only.
With the exception of the CEO, the other appointed members of the Executive Management Team are members of the HSE pension scheme (and the Voluntary Hospital Superannuation Scheme in the case of the seconded member), and their pension entitlements do not extend beyond the standard entitlements of the public sector model scheme.
Note 29 Approval of Financial Statements The financial statements were approved by the Board on the 13 May 2020.

HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Statement from the Director General
Statement from the Director General It gives me great pleasure to present the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Health Service Executive (HSE) for 2018.
The past year has seen a number of significant events which have been exciting but also challenging.
As part of the next important step on our reform journey we are working with our colleagues in the Sláintecare Programme Implementation Office to develop an Action Plan which will deliver real change during 2019 as the first year of this ten-year journey, changes which are widely recognised as being essential given the changing demographic profile and the expectations around clinical governance and standards.
We are continuing to deliver services in an environment where the population is growing, the number of people seeking to access services is higher than ever before and where public expectations for quality services, understandably, continue to increase.
New HSE Board
The HSE has welcomed and is fully supportive of Sláintecare which presents a ten-year vision to transform Ireland’s health and social care services.
In particular, the publication of the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy during the year represents real progress as it provides the framework for a comprehensive reform programme which is system-wide.
We now have a direction for the next ten years and the actions to be taken in the first three years of the Sláintecare implementation process.
The focus is on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health and social care services are delivered in Ireland.
In addition, the membership of the Sláintecare Implementation Advisory Council was announced.
It comprises 23 members from a range of backgrounds, including a number of clinical leaders, patient advocates and service user representatives along with a number of independent change experts from outside the health service who will bring expertise and an independent perspective.
This is a critical element in the implementation of the Sláintecare vision with the council providing advice and support on the delivery of the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
A key Sláintecare recommendation is the establishment of an independent Board for the HSE in order to strengthen governance in the health system.
Under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, to be enacted in early 2019, the Board will be the governing body of the HSE and will be accountable to the Minister for Health for the performance of its functions.
The CEO of the HSE will be accountable to the Board.
Priority issues for the new HSE Board will include: •
delivering effective and safe services within the resources allocated
developing and implementing an effective performance management and accountability system in the HSE
developing a plan for building public trust and confidence in the HSE and the wider health service
ensuring the HSE’s full support for and implementation of the Government’s programme of health reform as set out in the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy.
I welcome the announcement during the year of the appointment of Ciarán Devane as the incoming Chair of the new Board and can assure him of the full support of all staff working in the health service.
We look forward to the appointment of the remaining members of the Board prior to the enactment of the legislation.
We also look forward to working with the new Board once established and, in particular to developing a three-year Corporate Plan that reflects the ambition of Sláintecare.
Statement from the Director General
CervicalCheck Programme
Service Delivery
The past year was extremely challenging for the health service as a result of issues which arose from the audit process in CervicalCheck, our national cervical screening programme.
At the centre of this was our failure to communicate with the women involved.
These women should have been informed and the HSE apologised unreservedly for our short-comings in that regard.
I reiterate that apology now.
Through the CervicalCheck programme over 100,000 cases of abnormal cervical cells have been detected and treated since 2008 – many of these could have developed into cancer if not detected through screening.
It is essential that the public has confidence in this vital service.
While I believe that recent annual increases in the HSE’s annual budget allocation have helped us to make significant improvements in many areas of our operations, there are still significant challenges in terms of service delivery.
In particular, we face challenges with waiting times for elective inpatient treatment and outpatient appointments.
We must ensure that we continue to maximise efficiency in the delivery of these services.
We also need to ensure that we are delivering services as close as possible to patients, with a focus on removing our over-reliance on hospital-based service delivery through the development of appropriate community-based services delivered within the Community Health Network.
A properly resourced capital building and equipment replacement programme will help to deliver services that are both accessible and safe.
In this regard, we welcomed the publication of the final report of the Scoping Inquiry by Dr Gabriel Scally and his team.
I acknowledge the focus and commitment of Dr Scally and his team and the patient-centred approach that they have taken.
The recommendations contained in the report are comprehensive and far ranging and we have moved swiftly to implement all 50 recommendations through an extensive implementation plan which we published and update on a monthly basis.
More importantly however is the absolute requirement of our health service to learn from issues like this to ensure that we don’t repeat our mistakes.
During the year ahead we will continue to develop our systems of open disclosure to ensure that we inform our patients of all significant events in a timely, honest and transparent manner.
Uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among girls showed a marked increase in 2018.
We look forward to the extension of this vital vaccine to boys in 2019 and to the introduction of HPV screening over the next twelve months which will both aid in the eventual eradication of cervical and other cancers.
Patients, Service User and Staff Engagement
One of the great attributes of a strong and vibrant organisation is its willingness and ability to receive and act on feedback from its key stakeholders.
This will help us to ensure that we truly live our values of Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning and to ensure that we develop a health service that is driven by quality and safety.
During 2018 we carried out our second annual National Patient Experience Survey which was run jointly with the Department of Health (DoH) and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).
The results of this survey were encouraging and have led to hospital specific action plans to address issues raised.
We also conducted a system-wide staff engagement survey where people working in agencies across the public health system were given an opportunity to share their views and opinions on their health service.
As with the views and suggestions of our service users, we will seek to ensure that we address areas of concern and also accentuate what is good in what we do.
Following the Referendum in May 2018, extensive planning and engagement took place to prepare for the introduction of a safe, high quality termination of pregnancy service.
A contract was agreed to allow general practitioners (GPs) to provide terminations at nine weeks of pregnancy and under in a primary care setting.
The hospital based service commenced in nine hospitals, increasing to ten in early 2019.
The possibility that the United Kingdom will depart from the European Union (EU) without an agreement continues to be a possibility.
This has potentially significant implications for this country and particularly for the delivery of health services.
In this regard, I was pleased to see the level of inter-agency co-operation across the health sector in the contingency planning process.
I am confident that we will have the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the continuity of services for those we serve.
Thank you
In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude to all staff working in the HSE, across our Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), Hospital Groups, Ambulance Service and National Services.
I also wish to give my thanks to all the members of the Directorate, Leadership Team and our Risk, Audit and other Committees.
Your commitment, professionalism and dedication are vital to ensuring that we strive to provide the health service that our population deserves.
Director General, Health Service Executive
Under the Health Act 2004 (as amended), the HSE is required to submit a Corporate Plan every three years, specifying the key objectives of the HSE for the period concerned.
The most recent Corporate Plan 2015-2017 concluded at the end of 2017 and in anticipation of the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy, it was agreed that a one-year update to the Corporate Plan would be developed.
A healthier Ireland with a high quality health service valued by all
Mission
This update builds on the strategic direction outlined in the Corporate Plan 2015-2017 and reflects additional strategic elements including those priorities described in the National Service Plan 2018.
 People in Ireland are supported by health and social care services to achieve their full potential
The Corporate Goals and Objectives 2018 sets out how we aim to improve our health service.
Our aim is to develop a first-rate service, available to people where and when they need it and our vision is to develop a healthier Ireland with a high quality health service valued by all.
This vision is accompanied by a mission statement that outlines how this vision can be realised.
People in Ireland can access safe, compassionate and quality care when they need it  
People in Ireland can be confident that we will deliver the best health outcomes and value through optimising our resources
Provide fair, equitable and timely access to quality, safe health services that people need
Underpinning our goals and objectives are the values: Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning.
Over the following pages, both achievements and challenges in 2018 are outlined.

In meeting our legislative requirements under the Health Act 2004 (as amended), this Annual Report also reports progress against our Capital Plans and provides detailed financial statements for the organisation.
Governance
Following the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, the HSE Directorate was established as the governing body of the HSE.
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 allows the Minister for Health to issue directions to the HSE on the implementation of Ministerial and government policies and objectives and to determine priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its service plan.
The HSE must comply with directives issued by the Minister for Health under this and the Health Act 2004.
In 2018, the Directorate had collective responsibility as the governing body of the HSE and the authority to perform the functions of the Executive.
It was accountable to the Minister for the performance of these functions.
The Director General, as Chairman of the Directorate, accounted on behalf of the Directorate to the Minister and was responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE.
The HSE exercises a wide range of statutory functions which may have significant implications both for individuals and for the public generally.
The legislation recognises that neither the Directorate nor the Director General could exercise all of these functions personally and provides for a formal system of delegation under sections 16C and 16H of the Health Act 2004 (as amended).
This Delegations Policy Framework sets out the framework and supporting policy guidelines that underpin good governance regarding the system of delegation of statutory functions throughout the HSE.
This allows these functions to be undertaken on an operational basis through the Leadership Team and their supporting structures within the organisation.
To provide assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its functions, the Directorate has established a number of Committees including an Audit Committee and a Risk Committee, each of which comprises one appointed National Director and external nominees.
These Directorate Committees act in an advisory capacity and have no executive function.
For information on the role and operation of these committees, see the Governance Statement and Directorate Members’ Report in Part II Financial Governance of this Annual Report and also an organisation structure as at 31/12/18 in Appendix 2.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to have in place a Code of Governance, which was updated in 2015 to set out the principles and practices associated with good governance.
The Statement on Internal Control in Part II Financial Governance of this Annual Report reflects our compliance with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.
The enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018 will provide for the re-establishment of a HSE Board in 2019 to strengthen independent oversight and performance of the HSE, with the Chair of the Board selected in 2018.
The establishment of the Board is an important step in improving governance arrangements and is a priority in the implementation of Sláintecare.
The HSE Executive will work proactively with the new Chair and the new Board to ensure it can work effectively as well as responding efficiently and productively to a range of new governance requirements stemming from these new arrangements.
Our Workforce
We are committed to putting people at the heart of everything we do, delivering high quality healthcare to our patients, service users, communities and the wider population.
The Health Services People Strategy 2015-2018, recognising the vital role of staff at all levels of our organisation, was developed and implemented to engage, develop, value and support our workforce in addressing the many challenges in delivering health and personal social services.
An updated strategy is in development, to further build on this work.
Staff engagement •
Staff feedback is an important method of identifying opportunities for improvement and one way to do this is through the National Staff Survey, conducted every two years to assess current staff opinions.
In 2018, 15% of staff participated in the survey with the majority of responses showing improvements since the last survey was conducted, an indication that the policies being implemented (Health Services People Strategy 20152018, Dignity at Work Policy for the Health Service, Leadership training, etc.) are having a positive effect.
Key findings (some of which can be seen on page 10) will be used to further improve the working lives of staff, leading to better services for healthcare users and better care for patients.
Our Organisation
Improving Communication
Thirty-nine healthcare staff completed the HSE Irish Sign Language (ISL) Programme this year.
Knowledge of ISL assists communication and good customer and patient care support, helping to break down barriers that may be experienced by deaf employees and service users.
The National Staff Engagement Forum met five times during the year.
The forum promotes staff engagement, encouraging staff to have a strong sense of connection to the organisation.
Recruitment and retention •
A recruitment awareness campaign was run at the beginning of the year to which a total of 2,914 individuals responded from Ireland and abroad.
The campaign demonstrated the benefits and reach of a social and digital media approach in creating recruitment awareness.
A new national Strategy for Doctors’ Health and Wellbeing 2018-2021 was announced, outlining standards to apply from the first day in medical school up to and including retirement, and addressing the unique challenges at every stage of a doctor’s working life.
A pilot programme, delivered in close collaboration and partnership with the Leinster Institute of Professional Development (LIPD), is enabling healthcare support workers to train as healthcare assistants.
Directors of Nursing in South Tipperary General Hospital and St. Patrick’s Hospital, Cashel have worked closely with the LIPD to ensure the course is highly practical and is applicable and transferable to both the acute and community setting.
A training programme was rolled out for Health and Social Care Professionals (HSCPs) to equip HSCP supervisors with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for the effective engagement in and delivery of professional supervision as part of their role.
More than 25 professions were eligible to apply for the programme. •

Employment levels
The health service is the largest employer in the state with 117,857 whole-time equivalents (WTEs) employed by the HSE and section 38 agencies, at 31st December 2018.
Since 2017, overall staffing levels have increased by 3.1% or 3,560 WTEs.
All staff categories showed growth in 2018 compared with 2017.
The largest growth was seen in patient and client care (1,011 WTEs), including ambulance staff, followed by nursing and midwifery (867 WTEs) which is the largest staff category and continues to constitute around one-third of the health workforce.
Medical and dental staffing rose by 346 WTEs.
European Working Time Directive
A key focus for the health service continues to be improving compliance with the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) amongst NCHDs and social care workers.
As of end December 2018, there was:
98% received 11 hour daily rest breaks or equivalent compensatory rest (0% increase on December 2017).
98% compliance with 30 minute breaks (1% decrease on December 2017).
99% compliance with weekly/fortnightly rest or equivalent compensatory rest (0% increase on December 2017).

Our Organisation
Nursing and Midwifery
Our nurses and midwives make up approximately one third of the health service workforce and are at the frontline in ensuring service delivery that reflects our organisational values of Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning.
A number of initiatives were developed and progressed during the year to support nursing and midwifery services in meeting the health and wellbeing needs of the population.
Shaping the Future of Intellectual Disability Nursing in Ireland was launched.
The report, which was developed in conjunction with the Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services and with services, sets out a clear direction for the future role of intellectual disability nursing ensuring the best possible health and social care is delivered to people with an intellectual disability.
A Guiding Framework for the Development of Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioners – Acute Medicine was published.
Its aim is to ensure that all acute medical patients have a better patient experience with improved communication, receiving safe, quality care with timely diagnosis and correct treatment in an appropriate environment.
Guidelines and policies were produced on a number of practice development initiatives including: –
HSE National Wound Management Guidelines.
National nurse and midwife medicinal product prescribing policy.
Quality Care-Metrics are quantifiable measures that capture the quality of the nursing and midwifery care process in relation to agreed evidence-based standards.
A national research study was completed during the year to identify the important areas of nursing and midwifery care that should be measured, reflecting on the processes by which we provide care, and the values underpinning practice.
The research resulted in a suite of seven reports that outline a suite of metrics and indicators for the following areas: acute care, older persons, mental health, intellectual disability, midwifery, children’s and public health nursing.
The Caring Behaviours Assurance System – Ireland (CBAS-I), an evidence-based system for assuring the delivery of safe care, was extended to the UL Hospitals Group in 2018.
The Digital Professional Development Planning Framework was launched to enable nurses and midwives to identify short and long term professional goals for the benefit of themselves, their service users and the organisations in which they work.
The evaluation report on the implementation of electronic rostering into Letterkenny University Hospital was launched, the findings of which will be used to guide the roll-out of eRostering to other hospitals throughout the country.
The eRostering system is used to create and manage staff rosters, align rosters with service demands, record staff attendance and report compliance with employment law.
Education and training: –
605 nurses/midwives were supported to undertake leadership training.
16,000 staff accessed the Clinical Leadership Competency on-line resource.
1,183 nurses or midwives have authority to prescribe medicines.
386 nurses or midwives have authority to prescribe ionising radiation (x-ray).
1,500 nurses and midwives were sponsored to undertake postgraduate education programmes.
3,622 continuing education programmes were provided to 37,893 nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants through the centres of nursing and midwifery education.
During Storm Emma, healthcare staff clearly demonstrated that care for our patients and service users is at the heart of everything we do.
Key services were able to continue due to the dedication of those who found ways of getting to and staying at work. Additional information on the impact of
Storm Emma can be found throughout this Annual Report.

Pay and Staffing Strategy and Funded Workforce Plans
The 2018 Pay and Staffing Strategy was a continuation of the 2017 strategy, central to which is compliance with allocated pay expenditure budgets.
These budgets are set out at different levels within the organisation through annual funded workforce plans and are robustly monitored, managed and controlled.
This process was further enhanced in the last quarter of the year in line with the Performance and Accountability Framework.
An integrated approach, supported by National HR and Finance, focused on the aim to reduce and/or control pay costs and implement cost containment plans, in addition to maximising the performance and productivity of the health workforce.
Finance
Acute voluntary hospitals €2.239bn (52%).
Non-acute agencies €2.044bn (48%).
Over 2,150 agencies were funded, with over 4,800 separate funding arrangements in place.
Nine agencies accounted for over 50% of the funding.
Work continued to enhance governance arrangements with section 38 and section 39 funded agencies.
In particular: •
Governance documentation for 2018 was again made available to the operational system from the beginning of the previous November, with a substantial number of Service Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements being completed and signed by agencies before the end of February.
Briefing sessions on the governance framework for both HSE staff and staff from agencies were held in all CHOs during November and December.
The Annual Compliance Statement process continued, which requires all section 38 and section 39 agencies (which are funded by more than €3m annually) to submit a statement annually to the HSE confirming their compliance with good governance practice in the previous year.
The Annual Compliance Statement process covers approximately 93% of the funding released to section 38 and section 39 agencies.
These statements were reviewed and matters requiring further clarification were addressed with the agencies concerned.
The review of governance at Board and Executive level in section 38 agencies made good progress with a further 18 reviews finalised in 2018 and 22 reviews completed to date.
Preliminary work on the establishment of Contract Management Support Units (CMSUs) was concluded in 2018 and four pilot CMSUs will be established in 2019.
Total capital expenditure in 2018 was €528 million (m) including €468.4m for capital projects and €59.6m for ICT capital projects.
This included capital grants to voluntary agencies of €180.3m.
Further information on capital and ICT infrastructure developments can be found on pages 102-104.
Payroll
The overall pay bill of the health service, excluding voluntary service providers and superannuation, increased by €224m (4.8%) in 2018 to a total of €4.9bn.
Basic pay increased by €204m (6.0%) and other allowances increased by €30m (5.3%).
Governance arrangements with the non-statutory sector
The HSE provided funding of €4.3bn to non-statutory agencies to deliver health and personal social services:

85% of people perceive their health to be very good or good
increase in population since 2017
Life expectancy
ex-smokers in Ireland
25% of population are children aged between 0 and 17 years
Over 4.8m people live in Ireland (Central Statistics Office (CSO), 2018).
There was an overall increase of 64,500 people from April 2017 to April 2018, the largest annual increase since 2008.
The population in 2018 has grown by an estimated 2% since the 2016 Census.
The population is growing across all regions and age groups, with the most significant growth seen in the older age groups.
Latest population projections released by the CSO indicate that this population growth is set to continue for at least the next two decades.
Assuming moderate changes in migration and fertility rates, the total population is projected to reach 5.64m by 2038 with more than one in five people expected to be aged 65 years or over.
Notwithstanding this growth in the older population, in 2016 approximately a quarter of our population are children aged 0-17 years.
Ageing population
The number of people aged 65 years and over has increased in the period between 2011 and 2016 Census from 11.6% to 13.3% and by 35% since 2009, which is considerably higher than the EU average of 16% over the same period.
It is projected that the number of people aged 65 years and over will increase by 21,969 (3.3%) in 2019 and 23,327 (3.3%) in 2020.
Similarly, the number of adults aged 85 years and over will increase by 3,116 (4.3%) in 2019 and by 3,369 (4.5%) in 2020.
This continuing growth is due mainly to medical innovations, enhanced treatments and improved lifestyles.
Living longer however brings with it challenges such as chronic disease, social isolation, disabilities and cognitive loss which have major implications for the future planning and provision of health services.
Birth rates
There were 62,053 births in 2017 and live birth numbers are gradually decreasing year on year with a 2.9% decrease between 2016 and 2017.
This is mainly due to the decline in recent years of the number of women in child-bearing age groups and will in turn result in a steady reduction in the number of births over the coming decade.
Despite reductions in the number of births in recent years, the fertility rate in Ireland, at 1.82%, remains the third highest in the EU.
The second highest rate is in France and the highest rate is in Sweden.
Life expectancy in Ireland is now above the EU average having increased by almost two and a half years since 2005.
The greatest gains in life expectancy however have been achieved in the older age groups, showing lower mortality rates from conditions such as heart disease and cancer.
People living longer show that we are managing to prevent and treat diseases more effectively.
Mortality rates from circulatory system diseases decreased by 31.5% between 2008 and 2017, and cancer death rates decreased by 11.3% over the same period.
Transport accident mortality rates have fallen by 44.5% in the past decade (Health in Ireland – Key Trends 2018, DoH).
Suicide rates have decreased by 5.5% between 2005 and 2014 (CSO 2018).
Survival rates from breast, cervical, colon and rectal cancer have improved in the last 15 years.
However, with the exception of rectal cancer, the five year survival rates between 2000 and 2004 and between 2010 and 2014 are lower in Ireland than the average for Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.
Chronic disease
The three most common chronic diseases are cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease and these give rise to three quarters of deaths in Ireland.
It is estimated that over 1.07m people over the age of 18 years currently have one or more chronic diseases (based on analysis of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), wave1, 2017 and Quarterly National Household Survey, special module on health, 2010).
As people age however, chronic conditions become more prevalent.
The number of people aged 50 years and over, living with one or more chronic disease, is estimated to increase by 40% from 2016 levels, to 1.09m in 2030 (based on analysis of TILDA data, 2018).
Multi-morbidity is common in older people with 45.3% of adults aged 65 years and over affected by arthritis, 44.4% by high blood pressure, 11.8% by diabetes and 3.7% by stroke (TILDA wave 3, 2014-2015).
Marginalised Groups
Ethnic and minority groups within our population include Travellers (30,987, CSO, 2016), asylum seekers (5,670 pending applications, Irish Refugee Council, 2017) and those who are homeless (6,194 adults and 3,559 children, Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, 2018).
Evidence indicates higher morbidity and mortality amongst these groups including poor mental health.
Lifestyle Risk Factors
Many diseases and premature deaths are preventable.
Increased morbidity and mortality are strongly related to lifestyle-based health determinants such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and unhealthy eating, all of which have the potential to jeopardise many of the health gains achieved over the past decade.
The HSE is sustaining its focus on prevention and promotion through a wide variety of campaigns and interventions to address lifestyle risk factors.
These statistics and trends provide us with an understanding of the demographic change and the challenges we face which have implications for future planning and health service delivery.
Findings from a number of analyses and surveys, published in 2018 can be seen over the next few pages.
The aim of these is to support and inform future policy and planning in the health service.

Healthy Ireland
Healthy Ireland Survey 2018, Summary of Findings was launched.
As part of the Healthy Ireland Framework, this is an annual face to face survey commissioned by the DoH and conducted by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI).
The survey of over 7,500 people aged 15 and over living in Ireland, gives an up-to-date picture of the health of the nation and reports on many lifestyle behaviours.
Drinkers from more disadvantaged areas are more likely to binge drink (43%) than those from more affluent areas (33%).
Of the five unhealthy food types measured (sweets, cakes and biscuits, salted snacks, pastries and takeaways), 34% of people consume at least one of these daily and 91% consume at least one of these weekly.
17% smoke daily and 3% smoke occasionally.
85% perceive their health to be very good or good with 3% perceiving their health to be very bad or bad.

Harm from others’ drinking
The Untold Story: Harms experienced in the Irish population due to others’ drinking report was launched in 2018, setting out findings on the harms experienced as a result of other people’s drinking in the Republic of Ireland.
The report is based on findings from the first dedicated Irish survey on alcohol harm to others, known as AH20.
The report found that: •
One in six carers (16%) reported that children, for whom they had parental responsibility, experienced harm because of someone else’s drinking.
One in every two people (51%) reported experiencing harm due to strangers’ drinking in the past 12 months.
Three in every five people (61%) reported having a known heavy drinker in their life.
One in seven workers (14%) reported workrelated problems due to co-workers’ drinking.
The total estimated cost of AH20 as assessed in this survey was €862.75m.
Harms that are prominent throughout the report include: feeling unsafe, being harassed or insulted verbally, physical harassment, stress, having less money for household expenses, sleep disturbances, being a passenger with a drunk driver, ruined belongings and having to leave home for safety reasons.
The report also found that: women carry the burden of alcohol’s harm to others in the home; men carry the burden of alcohol’s harm to others in the workplace and younger adults are at greater risk of harm from others.

Listening to our Service Users
Listening to the views, concerns and experiences of patients is vital in ensuring we provide high quality care.
We continually engage with patients and service users to ensure their needs are at the centre of service delivery.
A number of areas were progressed during the year to promote patient and service user involvement across our health service.
Deirdre King De Montano, Business Manager, Clinical Director’s Office; Miriam McCarthy, PALS Manager; and Barbara Meaney, Staff Officer, Peri-operative Services encouraging all staff to check out the results of the National Patient Experience Survey. “
National Patient Experience Survey
All patients aged 16 and over, discharged in May, who spent 24 hours or more in one of the forty participating hospitals and had a postal address in the Republic of Ireland were asked during the year to complete the National Patient Experience Survey, a nationwide survey asking people for feedback about their stay in hospital.
The survey, which first launched in 2017, asked patients about their experiences of hospital care in order to find out what is working well in our health service, and what needs to be improved. “
Over 13,000 people participated, a strong response rate of over 50%.
Key findings included: •
84% of respondents said that they were always treated with respect and dignity while in hospital, with 16% reporting a fair to poor experience.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
97% of those who had important questions to ask said that nurses on the ward answered questions in a manner that they could understand.
82% had confidence and trust in the hospital staff that treated them.

Discharge or Transfer
What we have done •
Quality improvements projects were put in place across all Hospital Groups with the aim of improving patient experience of ED services.
ED teams across all hospitals have reviewed patient suggestions for improvements to inform their quality improvement priorities at local level.
In addition to work being conducted by individual hospitals, support for Hospital Groups in improving quality in ED will be provided by Quality Improvement in collaboration with the Emergency Medicine Programme.
A thorough review of the survey’s 2018 findings on food related questions has been conducted by the Clinical Lead for Hospital Nutrition, who has also aided in the dissemination of results to catering managers nationally.
This feedback will be used to prioritise key areas for improvement at both a national and local hospital level, including the development of the National Food and Nutrition Policy.
A National Lead has been assigned by the Director of HR to develop a programme of support for staff to enhance clinical and ward round communication in acute hospital services.
This work was significantly advanced in 2018 with the introduction of the National Communications Programme, delivering a training programme to staff across acute hospital services.
The HSE has developed a roadmap in consultation with over 3,000 patients, service users and members of the public to provide the information they need to access and navigate the health service and manage and improve their own health and wellbeing.
2018 and 2019 will see an enhanced directory of services available on-line and a more patient-centred approach to how we communicate the health information our patients need on-line.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Listening to our Service Users
The attention of doctors and especially nursing staff was excellent.
In general, improvements were seen over the findings from the previous year’s survey reflecting the significant efforts made by acute hospitals to address the issues highlighted in 2017.
It is clear that most of the patients who completed the survey had positive experiences of acute healthcare; however, some did not.
By sharing these experiences, patients help identify the areas where improvements have been made and still are needed.
Emergency department was very busy – I had to sleep on a very uncomfortable bed in a very busy environment.
Listening, Responding and Improving – the HSE response to the findings of the National Patient Experience Survey details the actions in place to address patient concerns.
Response to the survey is being co-ordinated through a national oversight group, with local implementation of quality improvement initiatives led by personnel from hospitals and Hospital Groups.
Patient and Family Engagement
The National Patient Representative Panel has participated in a number of focus, steering and working groups, and has provided input into a wide range of programmes and projects.
Examples of this engagement include: •
Providing guidance and advice on the implementation of the Hello my Name is initiative in CHOs and hospitals and promoting the What Matters to You initiative as a way of providing care that is more compassionate and person-centred
Consultation on the development of a Patient Safety Strategy
Participation in the oversight group for the national acute floor implementation to ensure joined-up care on admission to ED
Consultation on the development of guidance for communication of critical laboratory results in the community
Recruitment of 18 patient representatives to sit on a number of national electronic health record (EHR) project groups
Participation in the HIQA eHealth Standards Advisory Group
Participation in the Cross-Border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland Network
Membership of the HSE Drugs Committee
Participation in a focus group for MedLIS, the national medical laboratory information system
Participation in the working group for the HSE National Volunteer Policy
Consultation on the Review of Hospital Car Parking Charges to lay a foundation for establishing clear guidance and principles for hospitals
As well as the National Patient Experience Survey, findings from a number of additional surveys as outlined on pages 16-17 were examined during the year to see how they might inform improvements in our health service.
Such surveys included: • Healthy Ireland Survey 2018, Summary of Findings.
• Positive Ageing in Age Friendly Cities and Counties, Local Indicators for Ireland – Findings from the HaPAI survey.

Patient representative
A prostate cancer survivor used personal experiences to help others and to shape the new National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) Prostate Cancer GP Referral Guidelines.
Diagnosed in 2009, Tom Hope was given two options: surgery or active surveillance.
He chose the latter and after two clear biopsies Tom is now in good health.
Tom Hope at the launch of the
NCCP Prostate Cancer GP Referral
Guidelines. In 2016 he was invited as a patient representative to join the NCCP committee reviewing the Prostate Cancer GP Referral Guidelines.
This was an experience he valued, being given a chance to input the patient’s perspective of the test, receiving the results, reaction, anxiety and uncertainty.
After his experience of participating on this NCCP committee, he would encourage any cancer patient to participate on a committee as patient representative or in support groups where they can help others by sharing their treatment experience.
Office of the Confidential
Recipient The Office of the Confidential Recipient is a national service that receives concerns/complaints such as allegations of abuse, negligence, mistreatment or poor care practices in HSE or HSE funded residential care facilities in an independent capacity and, in good faith, from patients, service users, families, other concerned individuals and staff members.
It has dealt with almost 750 formal concerns/complaints from across the country since its establishment in December 2014.
In 2018, the total number of formal concerns/complaints received by the Confidential Recipient was 206, a slight increase on 2017.
The type of concerns raised include safeguarding, client placement/planning, access to equipment, level of staff to support client, financial charges, staff behaviour, and safety of care.
Further information and contact details for the Confidential Recipient can be found at www.hse.ie.
Communicating Clearly
Patients and service users ask us to be clear when we give them information about their health.
When we explain things clearly and with care and compassion, people have more confidence and trust in us and are more likely to take our advice, and follow medical guidance.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
In response to this, National Communications has produced a short leaflet to aid staff when speaking and writing to patients and services users.
A comprehensive set of guidelines for those producing letters, leaflets, websites, images for patients and services users has also been published, The guidelines contain a health literacy checklist which allows staff to evaluate if the message is clear and if it can be understood and acted on.
More written information could be given to discharged patients on their injury, treatment and aftercare.
Appeals Service
The National Appeals Service ensures that applicants for eligibility schemes (e.g. medical cards/GP visit cards, residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions, Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS)) are given their correct entitlement, and also provides governance to the HSE in relation to the correct application of legislation, regulations and guidelines.
2,330 cases were processed, in 2018, of which 31% were allowed or partially allowed.

However, many compliments go unrecorded and work is on-going to encourage all staff to record compliments as they provide information on the positive aspects of our service to assist in learning from what is working well.
There were 6,610 complaints recorded and examined by complaints officers under the Health Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005.
Of the total number of complaints received, 3,695 or 56% were dealt with within 30 working days.
Complaints addressed by Complaints Officers are either formal complaints or unresolved complaints escalated from point-of-contact in a frontline service.
During 2018, there was an increased emphasis on supporting staff to resolve complaints at point-of-contact, including the introduction of an interactive on-line module to empower staff to respond to these.
A total of 2,847 staff completed this module in 2018.
* Some received 2017 but processed in 2018.
Listening to our Service Users
Complaint handling tool
The HSE’s National Complaints Governance and Learning Team has developed, in conjunction with the Office of the Ombudsman, an interactive on-line complaint handling e-learning tool, hosted through the HSELanD portal and consisting of two modules:
• Module one is designed to help HSE staff, as the first point of contact, to resolve complaints from service users, encompassing stage one of the Your Service Your Say policy.
• Module two is designed for Complaints Officers and goes through the entire process of handling a complaint at Stage 2 under the Your Service Your Say policy.

Note: Some complaints contain multiple issues and therefore fall under more than one category.
Complaints under Parts 2 and 3 of the Disability Act 2005 741 complaints were received under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 in relation to a child’s assessment of need for disability services, a reduction of 0.4%.
Seven complaints were received under Part 3 of the Act, relating to access to buildings and services for people with disabilities.
Building a Better Health Service
Our aim is to be a world class health service available to people when and where they need it.
Laying the Foundations for Transformation
PHSI also provided support to allow key enablers for healthcare delivery to be progressed, including: •
Healthy Ireland and eHealth
Integrated models of patient care
Development of the new children’s hospital
Strategic programmes including quality and safety, and value improvement projects.
The Programme for Health Service Improvement (PHSI) continued to support transformation within the health service through a range of programmes, including development of a best practice management methodology.
Health service improvement
A key focus for the health service is to support better patient care and improve health outcomes by delivering effective, sustainable models of care that are integrated across service settings and in the person’s home and community.
Changes in our ways of working are designed to streamline performance and management across the CHOs, Hospital Groups and other services.
To enable this, the Strategy and Planning, Operations and Clinical functions of the HSE were established on 1st January, 2018.
These functions are engaging together in networked Commissioning Teams to plan health services and to solve complex challenges.
Commissioning Teams will work to strengthen relationships and collaboration between commissioners and service providers, moving clinical accountability closer to patients and building services around their needs.
This will provide greater equity and transparency, improving service delivery, influenced by collaboration between patients, services users and all stakeholders.
New ways of working
This will enable our healthcare system to provide patients and service users with care closer to home, to be more responsive to needs and to deliver better health outcomes with a strong focus on prevention and population health improvement.
A detailed action plan is in development, led by the Sláintecare Programme Office in the DoH, which will set out a series of work streams, designated actions and associated measures.
The HSE is committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure frontline delivery of the Sláintecare vision.
Implementation of Sláintecare
The Sláintecare Report (2017) and Sláintecare Implementation Strategy (2018) signal a new direction for the delivery of health and social care services in Ireland.
A whole of government vision for health, Sláintecare focuses on establishing programmes of work to move to a community-led model, providing local populations with access to a comprehensive range of non-acute services at every stage of their lives.

Values in Action
Values in Action is a structured culture development programme – using a social movement model – that aims to make the health service a better place to be for patients, service users and staff.
It is a long-term behaviour-based approach to creating a chosen culture in the health service and is based on nine visible behaviours centred on our core values of Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning.
The nine behaviours that reflect the three dimensions of our working lives (us as individuals, working with colleagues, and how we treat our patients and service users) are as follows: Personal • Am I putting myself in other people’s shoes? •
Keep people informed – explain the now and the next
Do an extra, kind thing colleagues in 2016 had little or no awareness of their stress and how it affected other people
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Building a Better Health Service
Values in Action is already showing very promising results, as can be seen on these pages, indicating that there is a substantial appetite among staff to support this movement throughout the health service.
To learn from what is changing in our culture, baseline surveys were carried out for each service area at the outset of implementing Values in Action, with changes tracked as the programme progressed.
We have discovered that, at the end of the first year of Values in Action, the prevalence of the nine behaviours increases by an average of approximately 10%.
By the end of the second year (as we are currently seeing in the Mid West), the behaviours begin to embed and become internalised as they start to become the norm for how things are done.
A baseline survey for Dublin North City and County Community Healthcare was carried out in May with comparative data due to be available summer 2019.

Building a Better Health Service
Developing leadership across the health service through the Leadership Academy, providing a consistent approach to programmes for staff as they progress in their careers.
The following initiatives were progressed in 2018 to improve patient flow and access to care: –
The Criteria Led Discharge (CLD) project commenced phase 1 of the pilot with the identification and approval of four implementation test sites.
The pilot will continue in 2019 and results will be used to measure the effectiveness of CLD.
The National Clinical Programme for Stroke continued to support sites delivering stroke specific rehabilitation services with a seventh site, Beaumont Hospital, added during the year.
Early Support Discharge (ESD) is the recognised model of care for patients, aiming to accelerate discharge home through the provision of stroke specific rehabilitation in the home setting.
In 2018, 366 patients were discharged to an ESD team, an increase to 142% since 2017 representing 20% of the total population of stroke patients discharged home from participating hospitals.
Further information in relation to the Health Services People Strategy 2015-2018 can be seen in the Enabling Healthcare Delivery section of this Annual Report.
Redesigning how Care is Delivered
The national clinical and integrated care programmes are working to redesign care from the traditional hospitalbased model to models of care delivered in the community.
Significant improvements can be achieved in the delivery of health and social care through this approach.
The Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons continued to support successful patient journeys for older people through an integrated care system, with 10 key essential steps that need to be in place to allow integrated care for older persons to be implemented, evaluated and sustained in a variety of locations.
Implementation of this 10-step framework was progressed in 13 sites nationally by the end of the year, including the development of redesigned care pathways and linkages in the areas of dementia, home care, falls and the single assessment tool (SAT).
(See next page for more information on the 10 step framework)
Timeliness for acute coronary syndrome treatment has significantly improved and a standard national delivery of treatment for patients has been developed.
A report, Heart Attack Care Ireland 2016, showed that treatment for heart attack patients in Ireland is on a par with, or above, international standards.
A number of initiatives were progressed through the national clinical programme for surgery:
A new national undergraduate curriculum for chronic disease prevention and management called Making Every Contact Count for Health Behaviour Change was launched in November, supported by the Integrated Care Programme for the Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease, aiming to bring a standardised approach to how healthcare professionals of the future are trained to support their patients to enjoy the best possible health.
(Further information on this can be seen in the Population Health and Wellbeing section of this Annual Report).
The Integrated Care Programme for Children progressed the implementation of phase 2 of the targeted hip ultrasound screening programme for infants at increased risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip.
Screening is available in 17 maternity units across the country.
A co-designed integrated care pathway for children with neuromuscular disorders has been developed, including an early detection algorithm, transition resource and a suite of informational supports for children, young adults and families.
The pilot of consultant delivered services in University Hospital Waterford continued, aiming to provide an increased presence of senior decision-makers and special interest clinics, to reduce length of stay and admissions, and improve EWTD compliance and satisfaction levels among patients, their families and staff.

Set up and accreditation of acute surgical assessment units (ASAUs) in four model 4 acute hospitals.
ED patient experience times were reduced by at least 50% in a pilot site, with patients being seen within 30 minutes of attending the ASAU.
A standardised See and Treat algorithm and a standardised pathway for minor procedures in outpatient departments were established.
The otolaryngology (ENT) Education in Primary Care initiative was awarded the Best Educational Project in primary care at the Irish Healthcare Awards.
As part of this initiative, 60 healthcare professionals were trained in the technique of ear suctioning to provide this service in the primary care setting.
Patients would previously have had to attend a hospital-based ENT surgeon for delivery of care.
The Theatre Quality Improvement Programme continued to deliver a systematic approach to process and pathway improvement.
Development of the Clinical Programme for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Adults continued and the model of care is being considered by the College of Psychiatry of Ireland.
Detailed plans are underway and recruitment has commenced for three demonstration sites aligned with the draft model of care.
Building a Better Health Service
The National Clinical Programme for Older People designed the National Frailty Education Programme in partnership with TILDA.
Its purpose is to co-ordinate and develop an integrated plan for treatment and rehabilitation, support and long term follow up.
National quality improvement pilots were progressed by the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) Collaborative in South Tipperary General Hospital, and St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin.
Early results included a reduction in admission rates and, where patients were admitted, an increase in respiratory reviews.
A Musculoskeletal (MSK) programme collaboration continued in 2018 between the National Clinical Programmes for Rheumatology and Trauma and Orthopaedics to address growing waiting lists, nationally, for both orthopaedic and rheumatology outpatient services.
A model of care for integrated MSK services between primary and secondary care is also in development.
An Asthma Education e-Learning Programme was developed by the National Clinical Programme for Asthma and the Asthma Society of Ireland and launched in November to provide the core knowledge needed by healthcare professionals to manage all aspects of asthma care in line with international best practice.
The National Clinical Programme for Palliative Care, in conjunction with the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care (AIIHPC), commenced the second phase of the pilot of the ECHO AIIHPC Nursing Home project.
The project is designed to support nursing home staff to improve their knowledge and skills in the care and management of patients with a wide range of palliative healthcare needs.
Models of care which have been completed include Specialist Geriatric Services Model of Care Part 2: mental health service provision; adult palliative care services; model of integrated care for patients with Type 2 diabetes; and the transition from paediatric to adult healthcare providers in rare diseases.
A number of clinical documents were also developed, including: –

Building a Better Health Service
Improving access and patient experience during the winter period
Winter is always a period of increased unscheduled care activity, however, winter 2017/2018 was a particularly challenging time for our health service.
An extreme weather event, Storm Emma, occurred in early 2018, and the severity of the storm and its effect on the healthcare system was profound.
The significant increase in unscheduled care admissions, which necessitated an extended recovery period to return to normal daily operations, impacted significantly on the capacity available to deliver scheduled care.
Seasonal influenza during winter 2017/2018 was at its highest level since the 2011/2012 season with peak influenza like illness rates exceeding 100 per 100,000 population (90 per 100,000 during 2016/2017).
Furthermore, there were 4,680 confirmed influenza hospitalisation cases notified during the 2017/2018 season compared to 1,425 in the previous year.
The Winter Plan 2017/2018 included a number of initiatives to support the health service during the busy winter period.
Key initiatives focused on providing additional acute hospital bed capacity, and measures to expedite patient discharges from acute hospital care, including: •
1,269 additional home care packages
128 additional acute beds were opened
3,526 patients were supplied with aids and appliances to facilitate their safe and timely discharge.
Key issues during the winter period include increased number of patient attendances at EDs, increased number of patients requiring hospital admission, infection outbreaks in the health service and wider community, heightened requirements for isolation due to infection prevention and control requirements, high hospital bed occupancy rates and increased numbers of patients in acute hospitals whose discharge is delayed.
The Winter Plan 2018/2019 focused on supporting services through the provision of: •
€10.6m for 550 additional home support packages
€4m for aids and appliances
€1.5m to support access to transitional care beds
66 additional community beds
4 additional rehabilitation beds
75 additional acute beds.
Additionally, a four week period of enhanced measures was put in place from 17th December 2018 to 13th January 2019, targeted at nine of the most challenged sites.
A Winter Action Team was established for each of the sites and additional funding was provided to support the sites during this focus period.
The enhanced measures included Frail Intervention Therapy Teams (FITT) to support frail elderly patients, extended availability of diagnostics, extended opening hours of acute medical assessment units and additional senior decision makers on site.
Other initiatives included:
Arrangements with private providers in terms of access to diagnostics and inpatient beds
Curtailment of elective and outpatient care, routine community activity and scheduled diagnostics
Scheduling of additional emergency theatre lists
Optimal usage of Clinical Hub and Hear and Treat by NAS
Optimal usage of day hospitals
Optimised public health nurse (PHN) and HSCP engagement to maintain patients in the community and/or facilitate early discharge
Public campaigns including Winter Wellness, Flu Vaccine and Under the Weather
Promotion of injury units as an alternative to attendance at ED.

Building a Better Health Service
Improving Performance, Efficiencies and Effectiveness
The Performance and Accountability Framework lays out how performance will be managed across the areas of: •
Access to and integration of services
Quality and safety of those services
Finance, governance and compliance requirements
The Workforce.
The emphasis within the framework is on recognising good performance and on improving performance at all levels of the health service, while setting out how CHOs, Hospital Groups, the National Ambulance Service (NAS), the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), heads of other national services and individual managers are held to account.
The framework was revised in 2018 to take account of new governance arrangements and organisational changes.
The role and membership of the National Performance Oversight Group, which has authority for performance and accountability oversight, was also revised in line with the new governance arrangements, and accountability and responsibility for performance was embedded further within the service delivery system.
A Performance Management Unit (PMU) is being developed to support improvement activities across the health service where there are significant performance challenges.
The PMU is an additional resource to support the performance escalation process in the Performance and Accountability Framework.
Research and Development
Health research, innovation and evidence are key enablers of healthcare systems, and a growing body of evidence indicates that healthcare organisations with a strong research culture deliver better care.
In 2018, the Research and Development function was established in the HSE to foster a research culture in the health service, increase the integration of research into health service delivery, improve research governance and contribute to the development of our research capacity.
strategic action plan for research as well as on-going work towards the development of a research governance framework required to safeguard public confidence, ensure good use of resources and encourage public and patient participation in research.
Enhancing EU and North-South
Co-operation There are many health services for which it is sensible to develop an all-island approach or where provision needs to be made for patients to move across the border to receive a service.
Examples of this North-South co-operation include the all-island paediatric congenital heart disease network, the North West Cancer Centre and the primary percutaneous coronary intervention service provided in Altnagelvin.
The HSE also partners (including as lead partner) on a number of EU funded programmes in the areas of acute services, mental health, population health, children’s services, primary care and older persons’ services.
These projects are financed by the European Regional Development Fund and are designed to support strategic cross-border co-operation in order to help overcome issues that arise from the existence of a border.
Preparing for Brexit
Given the potential impact of Brexit, the HSE has established a Steering Group to prepare for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and is working closely with the DoH and other relevant stakeholders to mitigate any negative impact of Brexit on our population’s health. A project team is also in place to review and coordinate preparations and contingency planning.
During the year, this function carried out the first ever research benchmark exercise within the organisation.
It showed that significant levels of research activity currently take place in the health service, in addition to that performed in collaboration with our academic partners. A parallel assessment was also undertaken to determine the current status of research governance and support structures, and a significant number of gaps were identified. This has informed the development of a HSE
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Quality and Safety
Our focus is on the quality of services we deliver and the safety of those who use them.
Continual improvement in the quality of care, learning from patient experience, and systems to maintain standards and minimise risk are essential in ensuring safer healthcare.
The National Patient Safety Programme
Healthcare associated infections (HCAI) are infections which can occur in hospital or community settings when attending for treatment, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the issue of bacteria that are no longer easy to kill with antibiotics.
CPE (Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacterales) is one of the newer AMR bacteria.
It was declared a national public health emergency in 2017.
An Oversight Group and Implementation Team are in place to support staff to improve patient safety by controlling HCAI and AMR.
One of the important steps in control of CPE is identifying people who are CPE carriers.
At the Health Service Excellence Awards the national sepsis programme won the Excellence in Quality Care award.
The number of sepsis associated hospital deaths has fallen by more than 20% over the past four years.
Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that can affect a person of any age, irrespective of underlying good health or medical conditions.
Sepsis recognition improved by 67% between 2015 and 2016 and by a further 15% by 2017; this improved recognition led to earlier treatment with the appropriate treatment bundle.
A national hospital-wide sepsis awareness and education initiative is on-going and, to assist in raising wider awareness, the Community Sepsis Awareness Campaign was launched during the year at the National Ploughing Championships.
Phase 3 of the Pressure Ulcers To Zero collaborative was completed in 2018, focusing on acute services, with 23 multi-disciplinary teams participating from acute hospitals in the South/South West and Dublin Midlands Hospital Groups.
A 67.2% reduction in newly acquired pressure ulcers was achieved during the 12 months to the end of this phase.
Preparation and planning for a Reducing Falls and Improving Bone Health Awareness programme commenced with high level engagement with relevant stakeholders, in preparation for roll-out in 2019.
Quality improvement initiatives, targeting medication management associated with blood clots, included:
Work is underway to expand this project to a wider area as well as looking at other ways to improve prescribing. Knowledge and awareness of AMR and infection prevention control improved through campaigns such as Under the Weather, European Antibiotic Awareness, Hand Hygiene Week, International Infection Prevention Control Week and the Winter Campaign.
Also, a new web-based resource was developed to help staff working in all areas of the health service, providing: –
Guidelines and information for hospitals, community services, GPs and public health nurses
Updated on-line antibiotic prescribing guidelines for GPs and dentists (www.antibioticprescribing.ie)
New hand hygiene training programme for community services staff
Information for patients.
A national project to train more people as Hand Hygiene Trainers resulted in 40 sessions being organised to train trainers in the community.
Those trainers gave 541 local training sessions, reaching 4,200 staff in community services.
A project in collaboration with 200 GPs in the Southdoc GP Out of Hours service aimed to reduce the percentage of those antibiotics prescribed that should be avoided in primary care, as a percentage of total antibiotics prescribed, from 45% pre-intervention to 22.5% by end June 2018.

Global Health Programme
The drive for improved quality and safety extends as far as Africa (Mozambique, Sudan and Ethiopia) with collaborative partnership agreements in place via the Global Health Programme to improve quality of care in health systems in developing countries.
The programme also delivers technical assistance to Irish Aid for Global Product Development Partnerships.
Medication safety improvements were also progressed in a number of other areas, including: –
Medication management in disability services
Psychotropic medication in people with dementia
Minimising risk with valproate in women and girls.
The National Early Warning Systems (NEWS), including the Paediatric Early Warning System (PEWS), Irish Maternity Early Warning System (IMEWS) and Emergency Medicine Early Warning System (EMEWS) are key patient safety systems used in acute hospitals to aid timely recognition of and response to a deteriorating patient.
The Deteriorating Patient Recognition and Response Improvement Programme completed a NEWS Audit of nine acute hospital sites, and new KPIs with multiple indicators for NEWS and IMEWS were rolled out for acute hospitals.
The Decontamination Safety Programme published two documents to support safe decontamination practice.
The Foundation Programme for Quality Improvement in Decontamination Practice has engaged with 12 acute hospital decontamination teams and one primary care dental team realising significant cost savings and improvements in service delivery. Two academically accredited minor award
programmes have been developed in collaboration with the Institute of Technology Tallaght which has led to over 150 decontamination practitioners participating in these education programmes in 2018.
Service User Involvement and Experience •
• An initiative, Patient Safety Stories, has been launched as part of the further development of a person-centred approach to incident management.
Taken collectively, these stories help us build a picture of how incidents can impact on people affected and will be used in training and education sessions to improve our understanding of and response to incidents.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Quality and Safety
Publication of the Office of the Ombudsman’s Learning to Get Better progress report showed that 27 of the 33 recommendations that specifically related to the HSE were implemented fully or were underway.
Your Voice Matters is a tool designed to capture patient experiences as part of the Patient Narrative Project, which aims to position the patient or service user centrally in the design and delivery of healthcare.
Phase 3 of the project is now on-going with feedback gathered being used to support the implementation of local service improvement initiatives.
106 participants graduated from the Royal College of Physicians Ireland (RCPI) having completed the Diploma in Leadership and Quality in Healthcare which teaches senior healthcare professionals and managers how to formulate and lead quality improvement initiatives in the workplace, translating theory and methodology into measurable outcomes such as quicker access to care and fewer adverse events. HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
The first formal education programme in Ireland for Clinical Directors and consultants aspiring to undertake leadership roles in healthcare commenced in March.
This was provided by the Institute of Leadership, Royal College of Surgeons Ireland (RCSI) with 33 participants in the first cohort (March) and 32 participants in the second cohort (November).
The person-centred culture national facilitator development programme has been completed by 18 hospitals (11 programmes in 2017 and seven programmes in 2018) with a total of 60 facilitators trained.
This training will enable teams to translate their shared values and beliefs about person-centred practice into how they plan and provide care that can deliver measurable culture improvement.
A practical toolkit Leadership Skills for Engaging Staff in Improving Quality was published in collaboration with the National Staff Engagement Forum, to support leaders to create workplaces which value staff.
Cork University Maternity Hospital trained staff engagement facilitators who lead quality improvement initiatives.
Microsystems training and coaching was provided to seven frontline ED teams in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.
Implementation support was provided to 20 frontline teams to roll out Schwartz Rounds, which are facilitated conversations with staff about the emotional impact of their work.
They improve staff wellbeing (reducing psychological distress) and teamwork which ultimately has a positive impact on person-centred care.
Over 70 staff engagement sessions, events and conferences were provided to staff in frontline services.
Over 780 staff were trained in clinical audit in hospitals and community settings.
A suite of on-line measurement and audit resources were also developed which are available on the HSE website.
A project was completed at Children’s University Hospital (Temple Street) to enhance its board’s understanding and assurance of clinical care indicators. Quality and Safety
Development of a number of National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) guidelines was progressed including: –

Safeguarding and Protection
Awareness campaign
The key message at the launch of the 2018 Safeguarding Ireland public awareness campaign was to encourage people to safeguard their future by planning ahead, putting in place an Enduring Power of Attorney to give financial and legal decision-making responsibility to a chosen and trusted person.
Other important decisions to be considered include notifying of future healthcare preferences and advance healthcare directives.
The HSE is committed to ensuring that all adults within its care, regardless of the setting in which they live, are treated with respect and dignity in a supportive environment where their welfare is promoted.
All vulnerable people have a right to be protected against abuse and to have any concerns regarding abusive experiences addressed.
Through the nine Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the CHOs all safeguarding concerns are treated in confidence and, as much as possible, are handled in a way that respects the wishes of the person at risk.
Over 10,000 safeguarding concerns were raised
The National Safeguarding Office Report 2017 was launched which indicates that: –
There has been a 28% overall increase in concerns being raised to the HSE
Physical abuse remains the most significant category of alleged abuse for those aged under 65 (46%, compared to 47% in 2016)
For those aged over 65 years, the most significant category of alleged abuse is psychological abuse (31%) and financial abuse (22%)
Financial abuse and neglect increase with age with the highest level of reporting in those aged over 80 years.
A review of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse – National Policy and Procedures 2014, which commenced in 2017, was progressed and is due for finalisation in early 2019.
The provision of training is integral to the roll-out of the HSE safeguarding policy and this is implemented through two main training programmes which are designated officer training and the safeguarding vulnerable persons’ awareness programme.
Indicative figures for 2018 show that: –
Over 1,500 people undertook designated officer training
Over 16,000 people undertook safeguarding vulnerable persons’ awareness training.

Safeguarding and Protection
Children First
Protected Disclosure
Children First applies to everyone
The HSE operates under two sets of legislation which govern protected disclosures in the health sector, the Health Act 2004 (as amended in 2007) and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.
To ensure the safeguarding of children: •
The HSE (Corporate) Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) was developed, setting out how the health service protects children and young people.
Publication of a CSS is a new requirement for organisations working with children and families and, due to the complexities of the health service with many services under its remit, a CSS is being developed at each CHO and Hospital Group level and, where necessary, subsidiary CSSs at individual relevant service levels are being adopted to include any further relevant risks and procedures applicable.
Procedures for the Protected
Disclosures Act 2014 were adopted by the Leadership Team in 2018.
The Protected Disclosures Unit continues to process disclosures received as well as providing support and guidance to disclosers and managers, and information sessions on protected disclosures across the HSE. •
48 protected disclosures were received in 2018.
National Independent Review Panel
The National Independent Review Panel (NIRP) continues to provide the HSE with a means to independently review circumstances involving individuals with a disability in receipt of, or known to, HSE or HSE funded services.
In 2018, five independent panel members and a service manager were appointed in addition to the existing independent chairperson of the NIRP.
Operational guidelines were developed which set out the purpose and principles of the NIRP and provide clear guidance on the process that will be followed for all reviews.
Assisted Decision Making
In order to support the roll-out of Assisted Decision Making, a national training and education plan was developed and 76 information and briefing sessions were delivered to 3,009 people on the implications of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) 2015 Act in acute, community and voluntary services.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Safeguarding and Protection
Open Disclosure
It is the policy of the HSE that service users who experience harm as a result of their health care are communicated with in an open, honest, empathic and timely manner.
Open disclosure involves an acknowledgement to the service user that an incident has occurred, providing a sincere and meaningful apology/expression of regret, keeping the service user informed and providing feedback on reviews and on the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the incident.
A number of initiatives have been progressed to support the implementation of the HSE open disclosure policy and programme: •
The open disclosure policy and programme is co-ordinated via the recently established National Open Disclosure Office which also provides strategic guidance on the implementation of:
(i) The HSE Open Disclosure Policy and accompanying guidelines (ii) Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and the regulations accompanying Part 4 of this Act.
(iii) The open disclosure national training programme
Over 31,500 staff members have completed staff training on the open disclosure policy, 362 staff have completed the Train the Trainer course and work has commenced with HSELanD on the development of three e-learning modules.
Work has also commenced on the development of a communication and open disclosure programme for medical staff, and training has been provided to open disclosure trainers and leads on the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017.
The HSE policy on open disclosure has been revised in response to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, 2018, the commencement of Part 4 of the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017 and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.
It is planned to launch the revised open disclosure policy in April 2019.
A compliance self-assessment tool will be developed to support the roll-out of this policy.

Excellence in Delivering our Health Services
In addition to the final six projects, the following three awards were also presented.
Attendees at one of the training events held during the Gathering.
Special Recognition Award Kieran Henry (The Gathering)
This award was presented to Kieran Henry, Advanced Paramedic, Emergency Medical Services, in recognition of his role in organising The Gathering, an annual event for those working in the frontline of emergency services.
The event which attracts emergency personnel from home and abroad allows ambulance, hospital, defence and policing services to join forces and train together, sharing their experiences, practising lifesaving skills and rehearsing how to deal with challenging scenarios.
A diverse range of training events were held during the course of The Gathering in 2018, including a simulation of an aircraft disaster.
Outstanding Employee Award
This award allows colleagues to recognise the broader personal achievements and contributions of individual staff members that set them apart from any particular project.
It recognises and celebrates the impact and effect that person has in terms of their personal commitment to health service delivery and the effect they have in their work community.
Twelve employees were nominated for this award, which was awarded to the late Tony Leahy who passed away in November.
Tony was a General Manager who played an important leadership role in realising many of the innovations in mental health and reform in recent years.
His vision was based on making lives better for all those who used services, their supporters and those who provided services.
Tony understood that unless we were inclusive of all voices in the planning of our services that change could not happen.
He was one of the first to invite those with lived experience and their families and supporters to sit at the national table with those who provide and plan for mental health services.
He championed the recovery approach and worked tirelessly to help build a modern mental health service which has led to the establishment of the office for Mental Health Engagement and inclusion of peer support workers supporting recovery on the mental health teams.
All of this work has culminated in the co-producing of the National Framework for Recovery in Mental Health 2018-2020, Tony’s ultimate legacy to ensure a consistent evidence-based approach to embedding recovery oriented practice in services.

Popular Choice Award
Frail Older People Rapid Improvement Programme
The Regional Hospital Mullingar introduced a Frailty Intervention Team (FIT) for patients over 75 years attending their ED.
By introducing FIT, a whole system pathway for frail older people is now in place, starting at the front door to ED, ensuring their needs are managed assertively and their length of stay in hospital is kept to a minimum.
When patients present at triage, they are screened for frailty and a comprehensive geriatric assessment is undertaken.
At that point, choice of care is also discussed enabling people to identify their preferences quite early on in their journey of care.
Appropriate priority referrals are then made to the health and social care professions within the community or hospital, as required.
The many benefits of introducing this programme include: •
Seamless transition for frail older people moving between acute and community services
Length of stay in hospital reduced
Number of discharges increased in the first seven days
Number of discharges home increased, thus reducing the requirement for convalescence by half
Hospital and community staff working together to provide the best service for frail older adults
Positive experience by service users, family members and carers noticing that their family member’s condition has improved more rapidly both psychologically and physically
Identification of other symptoms such as dysphagia and malnutrition with a broadened selection of foods made available to enable this to be addressed
Development of frailty education and training booklet for all staff to further support the care provided to older frail people.

This governance structure facilitates improved access to quality services supported by robust management and accountability arrangements at all levels of the service.
Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Services
Eye in the Sky
In July, the NAS was delighted to announce the utilisation of the first drone within the service.
The HSE under the Emergency Management Framework has lead responsibility in dealing with medical emergencies involving chemical and biological materials.
The use of drones will enable enhanced communication at the scene of an incident by providing an eye in the sky at accident scenes, allowing observation of the high-risk incident ground quickly and prior to deployment of additional staff.
The drone will also give teams a quick overview of patients’ condition and location, allowing the leader to direct paramedics towards them.
The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is a demandled service serving the whole population of the state.
Working in conjunction with the Dublin Fire Brigade, the Irish Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard and, at a community level, with First Responder teams, the NAS responds to emergency and urgent calls, transports intermediate care patients and undertakes adult, paediatric and neonatal retrievals.
Additional paramedics were deployed to improve response times in targeted areas including Galway, Donegal, Cork, Kildare and Monaghan. To support the expansion of intermediate care and aeromedical services, a recruitment process for additional staff was completed, enhancing performance and access for patients.
The Clinical Hub (phase 1 – Hear and Treat) which provides appropriate telephone advice on alternative pathways to care to 112/999 callers who do not have serious or life-threatening conditions commenced operations during the year.
The key benefits of this alternative model of care include: –
Care closer to home
Most appropriate pathway chosen and a reduction in ED attendances
Reduction in dispatches
Incidents dealt with more promptly.

Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Services
Storm Emma
Advanced paramedic Declan and Corporal Steve carried seven-year-old Logan 3km to get him to hospital during Storm Emma.
Logan needs medical equipment 24 hours a day and when the storm knocked out power lines he urgently needed to be brought to hospital.
However, blizzards and snow drifts meant no vehicles could get near his home.
Logan and his mother, Louise, started walking from their home and were met after a short distance by Declan and Steve who took turns carrying Logan, ensuring he reached hospital safely.
The number of Community First Responder schemes in place now stands at 210, in line with the NAS Implementation Plan.
Community First Responders are invaluable in responding to particular types of medical emergencies (cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, chest pain, choking and stroke) where it is essential that the patient receives immediate life-saving care while an emergency response vehicle is en route.
The National Transport Medicine Programme, which transfers seriously ill patients for specialist treatment, was integrated into the NAS.
It is now known as the NAS Critical Care Retrieval Service and operates from the Retrieval Co-ordination Desk based in the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC).
From June, NEOC has provided a single point of contact for all retrieval requests.
A cross border Community Paramedic Project was launched during the year, a collaboration between the NAS, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Community paramedics associated with the project received specialised training, accredited by Glasgow Caledonian University, which enables them to provide safe and effective care to patients in their own homes, reducing unnecessary ambulance transports to EDs.
The service operates in liaison with GP practices in Clones, Co. Monaghan and Buncrana, Co. Donegal.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Following the adoption of the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Framework document, two new clinical KPIs were developed and tested during 2018.
Both KPIs will come into operation in 2019 as part of a move to measure the effectiveness of clinical care to patients.
The NAS has established formal engagement with the HSE National Patient Forum, allowing the NAS to seek input from patients/service users in the planning, design and delivery of services.
The Education and Competency Assurance Plan continued to be rolled out across the service.
A recruitment process for the appointment of clinical data analysts has commenced to enhance clinical competencies and improve the quality of patient care.
Fleet management and maintenance have been strengthened with the appointment of a NAS fleet and equipment maintenance manager.
Acute Hospital Services
Organ Donation Saves Lives
Double lung recipient David, pictured above with his wife Katie, completed his second marathon in Berlin in September this year having already ran the New York Marathon last year.
He is ever grateful to his donor and the donor’s family, who have saved his life.
In 2018, the families of 81 people who had died, donated the organs of their loved one courageously and generously.
Acute hospitals play a key role in improving the health of the population by providing services including pre-hospital care for adults and children, emergency care, urgent care, short term stabilisation, scheduled care, trauma care, acute surgery and critical care.
Improving patient and staff health and wellbeing
• Implementation of Healthy Ireland plans to ensure everyone enjoys physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential is well underway in Saolta University Health Care Group, UL Hospitals Group, RCSI, Dublin Midlands and Ireland East Hospital Groups.
Work has also commenced in the South/South West Hospital Group on the development of their plan.
The Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy for Adult Patients in Acute Hospitals was approved in November and subsequently disseminated to Hospital Groups for implementation.
Uptake of flu vaccine among healthcare workers in hospitals increased to 44.8% in 2017/2018 compared to 34% in 2016/2017.
Health promotion managers are working with the Hospital Group Healthy Ireland leads to encourage the uptake of training programmes in Making Every Contact Count (MECC) and a skills workshop to ensure that hospital personnel have the required knowledge and skills to carry out behaviour change interventions.
As part of efforts to increase capacity in hospitals for patients, five additional critical care beds were opened in Cork University Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.
• New referral and elective care pathways to improve the patient journey commenced development for urology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, ENT, general surgery, paediatrics and gynaecology.
A new action plan, aiming to reduce the number of patients waiting for inpatient or day case procedures was conjointly produced by the HSE, DoH and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).
The number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure reduced from a peak of 86,111 in July 2017 to 70,204 in December 2018.
In addition, the number of patients waiting over nine months almost halved from 28,124 in July 2017 to 14,910 at the end of 2018.
A proposal was agreed with the DoH to validate outpatient waiting lists for patients waiting from six to 24 months (a number totalling 249,838 patients).
As a result of the validation, 69,836 patients were identified as no longer requiring outpatient appointments, ensuring more timely access for those patients remaining on the waiting list.

Cancer incidence in Ireland
As part of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026, several improvement initiatives are on-going covering various aspects of cancer services, including diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and survivorship support in both the hospital and community setting.
The key focus in 2018 was on implementation of the principles of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 – reducing the cancer burden, providing optimal care, and maximising patient involvement and quality of life.
An Irish Cancer Prevention Network has been set up in partnership between the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) and cancer charities.
A skin cancer prevention plan is being developed in conjunction with Healthy Ireland.
An Early Detection Project Group hosted by the NCCP commenced in December, looking at new ways to improve GP access to diagnostic tests for patients with possible cancer.
A group was established to improve public awareness of lung cancer symptoms.
A new report issued by the National Cancer Registry Ireland has indicated that the centralisation of cancer services has contributed to higher survival rates for patients, even after adjusting for factors such as age and social deprivation.
72% of all breast, prostate and lung cancer GP referrals are now received electronically.
A facility for including attachments has been developed, which should further assist the triage process.
There has also been a pilot of the pigmented lesion (suspected melanoma) GP referral form.
The Prostate Cancer GP Referral Guidelines were updated to reflect patient values, improve the quality of clinical care and reduce variation in practice.
As part of on-going work to improve the experience of and care for cancer survivors, two new guides, Sexual wellbeing after breast or pelvic cancer treatment – A Guide for Women and Good bone health after cancer treatment were launched.
• Cancer accounts for approximately 30% of deaths every year.
Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer and is responsible for up to one third of all cancer deaths.
Work continued on the configuration and testing of the National Cancer Information System (NCIS), which is scheduled to go live in 2019.
The system will provide an e-health solution for cancer multi-disciplinary meetings, supporting the care of oncology and haemato-oncology patients including electronic prescribing, scheduling and administration of systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT).
Recruitment of specialist clinical staff is underway for medical oncology, haematology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology and psycho-oncology services, and for additional staff to support rapid access clinics.
Work continued to support access for patients to new SACT agents and to support hospitals in meeting rising drug costs.

Women and Infants’ Health
The National Women and Infants’ Health Programme (NWIHP) was established to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, benign gynaecology and neonatal services, strengthening these services by bringing together work undertaken across primary, community and acute care.
Key priorities in 2018 were ensuring equity of access for women and their infants to high quality, nationally consistent, women-centred maternity care, including preparation for the implementation of termination of pregnancy services to be in place from January 2019.
The implementation of the new model of care for maternity services is well underway and a governance structure with a number of work streams has been established to ensure consistency of approach.
An additional 50 midwives were approved in 2018, to support the development of community midwifery, and a quality and safety manager is being recruited for each maternity network to support the function of a Serious Incident Management Forum, dedicated to maternity services.
Alongside Birth Centres are in development with the aim of each Hospital Group having at least one such facility within their maternity services.
The centres provide comfortable, low tech birth rooms for normal risk mothers and babies with midwives leading and delivering care within a multi-disciplinary framework.
Creating a Better Future
Together The National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026 was developed to transform our approach to maternity services, ensuring that women and their babies have access to safe, high-quality care.
The recommendations are being implemented through the National Women and Infants’ Health Programme.
The strategy contains four key priorities:
• Mothers and families are supported and empowered to improve their own health and wellbeing.
• Women have access to safe, high-quality, nationally consistent, women-centred maternity care.
• Pregnancy and birth is recognised as a normal physiological process and, insofar as it is safe to do so, a woman’s choice is facilitated.
• Maternity services are appropriately resourced, underpinned by strong and effective leadership, management and governance arrangements, and delivered by a skilled and competent workforce in partnership with women.

Prior to this, women or their families seeking the support of medical social work within UL Hospitals Group had to be referred by a healthcare professional.
The walk-in clinic will also provide information from other relevant agencies.
Patients and staff at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital are set to benefit from being included in the Irish National Orthopaedic Register (INOR).
INOR collects information electronically at pre-operative, surgical and post-operative assessment stages, from patients who are undergoing joint replacement surgery.
This supports early detection of implant performance and improves the efficiency of the review process.
Croom is the largest site to date and the third hospital in Ireland to go-live with the register.
Nenagh Hospital was unveiled as a national centre of excellence for cataract surgery.
All suitable cataract surgery within UL Hospitals Group is to migrate to the new theatres at Nenagh.

History was made when more than 50 staff from across the health service marched this year in the Dublin Pride Parade.
Participation in the parade was organised by the Health Services LGBTI+ and Allies Network, in line with the organisation’s policy on embracing diversity which is a key priority of the Health Services People Strategy 2015-2018.
National Human Resources •
2018 was the final year of the Health Services People Strategy 2015-2018 which was developed in recognition of the vital role our workforce plays in delivering safer better healthcare.
Further information on its implementation in 2018 can be found in the Building a Better Health Service section of this Annual Report.
Development of a new strategy to further engage, develop and support our workforce is underway.
People’s Needs Defining Change – Health Services Change Guide was developed to guide and support staff at all levels to become change leaders in our health service.
The framework provides practical assistance that can be adapted and applied to different national and local contexts.
Healthcare staff often have to deal with traumatic, adverse or critical incidents in the course of their work.
The Critical Incident Stress Management/Work Positive programme was reviewed, resulting in a joint project between the National Health and Safety function and Employee Assistance Programme to provide both preventative measures and specialised acute emergency mental health interventions in the aftermath of such an incident.
The Workplace Health and Wellbeing Unit participated in the 32nd International Congress on Occupational Health in March.
The theme of this year’s conference was Linking Research to Practice and the conference provided the opportunity to examine how work in the Irish health service compared with international projects.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
A number of learning and self-development programmes were made available throughout the country.
These included Corporate Induction programmes, First Time Manager’s programmes, People Management the Legal Framework, Leaders in Management, Coaching Skills for Managers, Clerical and Administration Officer Development programmes, Mid-Career and Retirement Planning seminars, together with an accredited national coaching service for staff.
In addition, numerous team development initiatives have been undertaken across the health service which are aimed at systemically improving team effectiveness.

Enabling Healthcare Delivery
The Healthmail service, used by GPs, GP support staff and pharmacists to send correspondence, including clinical patient information, electronically in a secure manner, has been rolled out as a service for optometrists to allow documents and images to be attached for timely and secure transfer.
The number of eReferrals continued to grow.
By year end, eReferrals represented 31.7% of all referrals for outpatient services (17,029 referrals in December 2018).
Following significant work on the design and build of a National Cancer Information System to support the shared medical oncology care delivery model, implementation began on a phased basis across the 26 systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) sites.
St. Luke’s Hospital, Rathgar is the first site due to go live in 2019.
The maternal and newborn clinical management system (MN CMS) went live in the National Maternity Hospital completing phase 1 of the system’s implementation.
The system allows information to be shared with relevant healthcare providers as and when required.
The individual health identifier (IHI) has been seeded into several health service systems including PCRS, as well as into 22 volunteer GP practices.
This improves patient safety by ensuring patients are identified accurately.
The systems for the new children’s hospital paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres are well advanced supporting a 2019 go-live.
These systems support and enable the delivery of paediatric care as part of an integrated clinical network.
35 hospitals have been supported in monitoring key unscheduled care metrics through the development of real time dashboards, allowing these metrics to be embedded in operational and strategic decisionmaking.
As part of the move to a national electronic laboratory record, the MedLIS project has continued incorporating national guidelines into its design and the system testing phase has been completed.
The IHI interface specifications have been agreed and a data protection impact assessment has been completed for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.
The National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) is reaching the end of its current implementation phase.
Implementation commenced in Children’s University Hospital (Temple St.) in October and a number of new services went live on existing NIMIS sites, including the vascular ultrasound department in University Hospital Limerick.
The Open Health Data Portal is available at http://data.ehealthireland.ie/ making it easy to find and access data from across the health service, including information on available health services, statistics on hospital cases and national waiting lists, and performance of new digital initiatives, such as eReferrals.
380 datasets are now available to view.
Finance Reform Programme
Established to deliver the phased implementation of a new Finance Operating Model for the Irish health service, the Finance Reform Programme is considered to be one of the key non-clinical priorities of the organisation.
A core element of the programme is the design and implementation of a single integrated financial and procurement system (IFMS) for the Irish Health Services.
This system will be based on the modern SAP S/4 HANA platform and will support our services in their efforts to deliver and demonstrate value for patients and their families.
• The single instance interim SAP solution was extended to its first voluntary site with the go-live in Crumlin Hospital.
• The procurement process for an external partner to support systems integration and change was commenced.
Technology Office
The Chief Information Officer •
Work continued on the development of plans to deliver the electronic health record (EHR) which has been identified as a key requirement for the future delivery of healthcare and is the cornerstone of the eHealth Ireland Strategy.
The acute EHR business case has been developed and the approval process is being worked through with the relevant government departments.
The One Programme is continuing to work towards creating a single platform for the delivery of all digital services for HSE staff.
3,200 existing staff have been migrated to the new HealthIrl domain and all new staff will be set up there.

In the development of the health service’s Cloud First Digital Strategy, key principles have been agreed and are in place.
These include the requirement for Cloud Solutions to have a business owner, be subject to risk assessment, follow the standard Office of the Chief Information Officer (OoCIO) business case approval process and comply with HSE policies and standards.
Work to improve governance of the strategy has also continued with a risk assessment template created and piloted in University Hospital Limerick and the procurement process for the required infrastructure and platform commenced.
A number of workshops were held in advance of the GDPR implementation date to assist in providing guidance and direction on compliance.
The supplier confidentiality agreement was also updated to incorporate GDPR regulations.
The ePrescribing pilot continued with total medical card prescriptions exceeding 200,000 by year end.
Work also commenced on the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) project to enable the decommissioning and verification of medicines on hospital and community sites.
Both initiatives are utilising digital solutions to ensure safer, more efficient ePharmacy delivery.
Health Business Services •
A national integrated staff records and pay (NiSRP) programme was established which aims to implement a single system with streamlined business processes for staff records and payroll services.
It will also introduce a self-service option and provide improved data in terms of payroll expenditure.
To provide for necessary upgrades to payroll systems, the first phase of the Payroll Stabilisation Project was implemented in the North East, with more than 10,000 employees and pensioners migrated to a new payroll software solution.
Phase 2 of the project will commence in early 2019.
In order to provide a more resilient systems environment for critical HSE functions and eliminate a number of existing risks, the Health Business Services (HBS) HR/ Payroll Systems Transition Programme completed the upgrade and migration of SAP® HR, Payroll, Business Warehouse and a number of finance systems to a new state of the art solution.
In September, the first Joint Digital Collaborathon was hosted by HBS with Business Shared Services from Health and Social Care Northern Ireland, and Ervia (formerly Bord Gáis) in the Trinity Innovation Centre.
In the weeks running up to the event, the three organisations brought forward three challenges each that they were facing in their digital journeys, and set these out in a series of animations and fact files that were shared with the 140 attendees.
Those at the event were able to select which challenge they took on and each organisation has agreed to take back the three solutions proposed for each of their challenges and to look at them in more detail.
Planning for next year’s event is already underway.

Appendix 5: Annual Energy Efficiency Report In response to legislation SI 426 of 2014 (previously SI 542 of 2009), which requires public sector organisations to report annually, this appendix outlines the HSE’s position on its energy use and actions taken to reduce consumption.
In 2013 the National Health Sustainability Office (NHSO) was established within the national Estates function, part of HBS, to develop and build staff, patient and public awareness of sustainability issues, and to deliver lower costs and a healthier environment.
Overview of Energy Usage in 2018
The NHSO is fully compliant with the requirements of SI 426 and has verified all HSE meter points for 2018.
This data is currently being validated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and it is anticipated that this verified energy consumption data will be available from the SEAI in mid-2019. Actions planned for 2019 •
The overview below is the verified energy usage in 2017 (excluding section 38/39 agencies).
The verified 2018 energy usage, when issued by SEAI, will be made available at www.hse.ie/sustainability.
Operating and Financial Overview 2018 Introduction 2018 was in many ways a challenging year for the HSE with significant pressures on acute, community and social care services contributing to a financial overrun by year end.
Despite the challenges faced by the HSE, progress is being made in key areas, which will bring real benefits to our patients and service users.
It has been acknowledged that the current model for healthcare in Ireland is unsustainable and needs to be significantly changed over the medium to long term.
This year saw the publication of the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy, which has provided a framework within which the HSE will focus on transforming health services over the coming decade.
In 2019 we will work with the new Board and Chair to publish a three-year Corporate Plan, aligned to Sláintecare and focused on providing a clear medium-term roadmap for staff, patients, service users and all stakeholders.
also an increasing number of older people presenting with challenges such as disabilities, cognitive loss and chronic disease.
The fact that we are living longer in better health or living longer with chronic disease is partly due to improved treatment of disease combined with other environmental factors.
Presenting with mounting incidence of chronic disease, requiring increasing intervention and followup services.
As people live longer with chronic disease this in turn creates a demand for additional health care services.
As the population ages there is a corresponding increase in chronic disease especially in the cohort who are aged over 50.
It is expected that the number of people in this age cohort living with one or more chronic disease is expected to increase by 40% based on 2016 levels by 2030.3
Presenting with healthcare needs driven by lifestyle factors including smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and obesity.
There are almost 1.7 million adults in Ireland who are overweight or obese and 5% of Irish adults suffer from type 2 diabetes.
The HSE has put in place programmes to deal with these challenges, for example, it has been reported that the prevalence of smoking has declined from 23% in 2015 to 20% in 2018.4
Presenting with healthcare needs arising from societal change, there is a strong link between poverty, socio-economic status and health.
The key elements of the HSE’s 2018 financial performance are summarised under the following headings: Strategic Context; Financial Overview; Income Analysis; Outturn 2018 By Service Areas; Finance-Related Initiatives And Outlook For 2019.
Strategic Context
Annually the HSE is required to prioritise safe services within the resources available to it and deliver the type and volume of services provided for in the national service plan while seeking to sustainably improve the quality of services.
Additional challenges experienced by the HSE during 2018 included: •
Staffing challenges both in terms of the difficulties in recruiting and retaining certain specialist healthcare staff, in the context of a global shortage of healthcare staff, and also the challenge to respond to service demands while seeking to keep our mix and number of staff within what is affordable.
Impact of major adverse weather conditions such as Storm Emma put significant pressure on our services which had to deal with a rise in unscheduled care admissions, as well as the challenge of ensuring safe access for patients and staff alike.
Our staff responded exceptionally well to this challenge.
In that context it is important to note the increasingly complex service demands and pressures arising from a population that is: •
Growing in numbers.
According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the population of Ireland, in the year to April 2018, grew by the single largest amount over a 12 month period since 2008.1 The ERSI2 projects that the population will continue to increase by up to 23% between now and 2030 adding up to another 1.1 million people requiring the services of the HSE.
• Living longer.
Life expectancy in Ireland has risen and the ESRI has indicated that by 2030 the share of the population aged 65 and over will increase from 1 in 8 to 1 in 6, and that the current number of people who are 85 and over is expected to double.
• Issues related to the cervical screening programme have impacted on those who use this service, on the staff in the programme and more generally on senior clinical and management capacity.

Preparing for Brexit.
The HSE has in place a steering group who are preparing the HSE for the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The HSE is fully supportive of the need to make significant changes to the current unsustainable models of healthcare and is committed to working with the Sláintecare Programme to deliver this change.
The Sláintecare Report acknowledges that in order to achieve the best outcomes for our population, safe, quality services must be provided in an integrated way, where and when they are needed.
Improved geographic alignment between the services currently provided by the Hospital Groups and CHOs is a key recommendation of the report.
It is expected that the design of revised structures, built around integrated care organisations, will be progressed in 2019. Hospital Groups Financial Overview
There are currently seven Hospital Groups responsible for the delivery of hospital services.
These Hospital Groups allow a co-ordinated approach to both the planning and delivery of acute care. The Acute Hospital sector including the National Ambulance Service accounts for almost 39% of overall HSE expenditure.
This is in recognition of the challenges faced in providing hospital services in the context of an ageing population, with a significant increase in the presentation of chronic illness, as well as the impact of lifestyle choices on the health of the Irish population.
At the start of 2018, via the National Service Plan, the HSE received revenue funding of €14.6 billion for the provision of health and social care services.
This represented an increase of circa €0.4 billion or 2.8% over the 2017 final allocation.
Transformation
Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) There are currently nine regional Community Healthcare Organisations responsible for the local delivery of community health services including primary care, social inclusion, older persons’ services, palliative care, mental health and disability services.
These services represent 51% of overall HSE expenditure.
By the end of 2018 the financial statements show a final revenue allocation of €15.2 billion.
This final budget includes the receipt of €625m of additional recurring revenue funding provided by way of a supplementary estimate for 2018.
The Letter of Determination received on the 23 October indicated that of the additional funding received, €50m was available for PCRS, €46m for State Claims Agency, €90m for 2017 First Charge6 , €76m for Acute services and €73m for Community.
€85m was also made available for a shortfall on Acute income in addition to €150m technical adjustment and €55m for a range of other support service areas.
Table 5 illustrates the 2018 and 2017 outturn for each respective service area and compares the growth year on year.
This is expanded under each service area narrative, further in this document.

Financial Governance
Income Analysis
The HSE delivers a range of health and social care services using financial resources allocated by the DoH as well as utilising income raised by private patient income, superannuation income, pension levy deductions from staff and pharmaceutical rebates.
Table 6 provides an analysis of this income.

Patient Income
Superannuation Income
Pension Levy Deductions

Total Income per AFS
The income graph below shows that in recent years the HSE’s income levels have started to recover from the drop in funding arising from the economic downturn.
Acute Hospitals Services
Acute services include emergency care, urgent care, short term stabilisation, scheduled care, trauma, acute surgery, and ambulance services as well as critical care and pre-hospital care for adults and children.
Hospitals continually work to improve access to both scheduled and unscheduled care and to maximise the provision of safe, quality services within the allocated budget.
The seven Hospital Groups provide the structure to deliver an integrated hospital network of acute care in each geographic area.
Linear (DOH Grant €bn)
The final outturn for Acute Hospital Services in 2018 was €6,299m after a challenging year impacted by reduced income from hospital private maintenance changes, increased impact of bad debt provisioning as well as additional expenditure arising from required operational services and increases in clinical non pay.
Despite the impact of Storm Emma, activity delivery in most areas was higher than the targets set out in NSP 2018, in terms of both activity volume and overall complexity.
The higher than expected operational costs experienced is a direct consequence of this enhanced level of service delivery.
Financial Governance
Social Care – comprising Disability and Older Persons Services
The challenge in 2018 for Disability and Older Persons’ Services was to continue to meet the rising demand for services as a result of an ageing population with a longer life expectancy.
The change in demographics in Ireland has meant that the health service has to adapt to the changing needs of its service users and patients including providing services for an increasing number of people with a disability or multiple illnesses requiring more complex service requirements. The final outturn for Disability and Older Persons’ Services in 2018 was €3,264m, which after the application of additional supplementary funding meant that costs in this service area were broadly in line with available funding.
HIQA has advised the HSE that all 1,149 disability centres are now registered as at 31 October 2018 under the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities.
This has been a substantial achievement for the sector.
Mental Health Services
The final outturn for Mental Health Services in 2018 was €891m.
In relation to service delivery there were a number of developments progressed in 2018, including: •
€6m investment in service infrastructure.
The advancement of the new National Forensic Mental Health Services capital project.
23.5 new individual placement support workers employed to support people who have attended mental health services returning to work.
9 new housing coordinators employed to support people with mental health needs to live independently.
The process of recruiting 10 CAMHS Advanced Nurse practitioners commenced.
Seven day community mental health services enhanced in all CHO areas.
10,796 children/adolescents; 27,124 adults and 8,553 psychiatry of old age patients seen by mental health services.
Primary Care Services
The final outturn for Primary Care Services in 2018 was €3,997m including the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS).
Core operational services within Primary Care, Social Inclusion and Palliative Care (excluding PCRS) reported a largely balanced result at the end of 2018, mostly attributable to once off time related savings relating to development funding.
Whilst the opening of multiple primary care centres over recent years has placed additional pressure on the primary care operational cost base, these facilities form a key part of the infrastructure required to provide primary care services to an ageing demographic and underpin the overall shift to primary care.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
The PCRS continues to face significant financial challenges and increased demand for services.
Included in the €3,997m outturn, were nonpay costs in relation to Primary Care and Medical Card Schemes totalling €3,176m which is mainly attributable to pharmaceutical services of €2,100m, doctors' fees and allowances of €572m and €225m on intellectual/physical disabilities, psychiatry and therapeutic services etc.
Health and Wellbeing Services
The final outturn in 2018 for the Health and Wellbeing Division, including National Screening Service and Environmental Health Service, was €214m, reflecting a range of required services which support our whole population to stay healthy and well by focusing on prevention, health promotion and improvement, reducing health inequalities, and protecting people from threats to their health and wellbeing.
The final outturn was broadly in line with overall expectations.
Finance-Related Initiatives
Finance Reform
The Finance Reform Programme continues to support the progression of one of the key non-clinical strategic priorities of the HSE, namely to implement a single modern integrated financial management and procurement system (IFMS) across the Irish health service.
This system, along with the standard national processes it will support, aims to change how Finance operates in the health service.
It will enable our finance teams to better support our services in operating within their available resources while also enhancing their ability to deliver and demonstrate value for patients.
The plan is to see IFMS implemented across 80% (by value) of the health service by Q1 2024, including HSE directly provided services and services provided by HSE funded voluntary organisations (s.38s and larger s.39s).
In 2019, we will complete the procurement of an external systems implementation support partner and commence the national design and build stage. Activity Based Funding
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
hospital activity and in our plans to begin to address the need for a structured approach to community costing.
In 2019, as part of the work on Sláintecare actions, we will bring forward a plan for the further development of ABF over the next three years.
Outlook For 2019
The HSE in 2019 will, within the level of available resources, continue to prioritise the delivery of safe services for its service users and patients whilst also proactively preparing for the implementation of Sláintecare.
The National Service Plan (NSP) 2019 sets out the type and volume of health and social care services to be delivered for the funding level provided by the DoH, and the level of staff that are affordable within that funding level.
The NSP 2019 provides an estimate of the likely scale of financial challenge facing our health and social care services in 2019.
It therefore sets out a range of measures and savings required to produce a balanced result in 2019, along with the risks to the delivery of the NSP.
These measures, building on the lessons learned from the 2018 value improvement programme, were formulated jointly from a combination of the HSE’s internal commissioning process, as well as measures that resulted from engagement with the DoH.
There will be an enhanced focus on the management of staffing levels within affordable limits and on overall financial management in 2019 within the context of the prioritisation of safe services.
This will be supported by a pay and numbers strategy and a savings measures plan, both of which will be agreed with the DoH.
The HSE will continue to place significant focus on efforts to progress the e-Health agenda including working with key internal and external stakeholders to secure the necessary approvals and investment to progress the Electronic Health Record (EHR) programme which is fully aligned with the Sláintecare agenda.
The Sláintecare Report (2017) and Sláintecare Implementation Strategy (2018) signal a new direction for the delivery of health and social care services in Ireland.
It has the potential to create a far more sustainable, equitable, cost effective system that delivers better value for patients and service users.
The HSE is committed to working with the Sláintecare Programme Office and all stakeholders to play our part in successfully bridging the gap between the vision for health service transformation in Ireland and delivery of that change at the frontline.
Changes will result in more positive experiences and better outcomes for patients, service users and their families. Financial Governance
Conclusion
Despite the on-going challenges outlined above, during 2018 the HSE has reported good progress in key areas, including: •
A decrease in inpatient and day case waiting lists (scheduled hospital care).
The provision of more integrated services for older people building on the work of the Integrated Care Programme for Older People.
Introduction of initiatives aimed at improving unscheduled hospital care, such as the Five Fundamentals Programme (leadership, governance, patient flow (pre and post admission), integrated services and using information to measure and monitor improvement).
Introduction of a number of initiatives in respect of nursing and midwifery services during 2018, acknowledging the importance of the skills and services delivered by our nursing staff who make up almost a third of the HSE’s workforce and who are at the forefront of the delivery of services.
In order to create the conditions within which the health service can maximise its ability to attract the investment envisaged by Sláintecare, it is necessary to get to the position where operating within the limits of the available budget is the norm delivered each year.
This includes improving our management of staffing levels so that staffing growth in 2019 is within the level that can be afforded and is therefore sustainable.
This would exclude technical issues such as pensions and recognised demand led schemes, in-year government decisions around public pay etc.

Governance Statement and Directorate Members’ Report Governance
Following the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, the HSE Directorate was established as the governing body of the HSE.
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 allows the Minister for Health to issue directions to the HSE on the implementation of Ministerial and government policies and objectives and to determine priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its service plan.
The HSE must comply with directives issued by the Minister for Health under this and the Health Act 2004.
In 2018, the Directorate had collective responsibility as the governing body of the HSE and the authority to perform the functions of the Executive.
It was accountable to the Minister for the performance of these functions.
The Director General, as Chairperson of the Directorate, accounted on behalf of the Directorate to the Minister and was responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE.
The HSE exercises a wide range of statutory functions which may have significant implications both for individuals and for the public generally.
The legislation recognises that neither the Directorate nor the Director General could exercise all of these functions personally and provides for a formal system of delegation under sections 16C and 16H of the Health Act 2004 (as amended).
This Delegations Policy Framework sets out the framework and supporting policy guidelines that underpin good governance regarding the system of delegation of statutory functions throughout the HSE.
This allows these functions to be undertaken on an operational basis through the Leadership Team and their supporting structures within the organisation.
To provide assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its functions, the Directorate has established a number of Committees including an Audit Committee and a Risk Committee, each of which comprises one appointed National Director and external nominees.
These Directorate Committees act in an advisory capacity and have no executive function.
Further information on the operation of these committees is provided under the relevant headings in this report and an organisation chart is provided at Appendix 2. Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to have in place a Code of Governance, which was updated in 2015 to set out the principles and practices associated with good governance.
The Statement on Internal Control reflects our compliance with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.

Meetings
The National Director of Quality Assurance and Verification attends all meetings of the Committee.
The Director General, other National Directors, or any other employees attend meetings at the request of the Committee.
The members of the Committee meet separately with the National Director of Quality Assurance and Verification at least once a year.
During the year, the Committee considered a wide range of areas of risk including: the Corporate Risk Register, HSE’s staff health and safety function, internal audit reports concerning the effectiveness of non-financial internal controls, CervicalCheck, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), quality and patient safety, disability services, National Independent Review Panel Report, consultants not on the specialist register, National Incident Management System, implementation of the HIQA Portlaoise Report recommendations, staff recruitment and retention, and unscheduled care. The National Director of Quality Assurance and Verification attended the Committee meetings to provide assurance on the effectiveness of the systems established by management to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on risks.
The Committee provided its advice to the Directorate and to the Director General principally by means of the minutes of its meetings and formal correspondence.
These minutes were made available to, and tabled at, meetings of the Directorate following the relevant Risk Committee meetings.
Liaison between the Audit and Risk Committees
The Audit Committee and the Risk Committee both have responsibilities for the provision of advice on certain areas of risk management and internal controls.
The Chairs of the two Committees met on one occasion during the year in order to co-ordinate the work programmes of the two Committees and to ensure continuing clarity in the Committees’ respective areas of responsibility.
Minutes of the meetings of each Committee were tabled regularly at meetings of the other during the year.

Meetings (Total Meetings 7)
Advice was provided by both Committees in relation to the development of the HSE’s Corporate Risk Register, encompassing both non-financial and financial risks, and in relation to improving the processes for managing and maintaining the Register.
In particular, it will: •
Advise the Directorate on OoCIO’s overall progress in the implementation of its Knowledge and Information Plan
Advise the Directorate through the Committee Chair on the risks to the implementation of the Knowledge and Information Plan, taking account of the current and prospective macroeconomic and healthcare environment, drawing on the overall healthcare reform agenda and the expertise of the group
The steps taken up to now have enabled the HSE to begin to create a structure that allows eHealth to truly become a catalyst for the reform of health care in Ireland.
Review and advise the Directorate on all the OoCIO divisional risk registers and advise of the risk management process in operation in the OoCIO
Advise executive management about the maintenance and promotion of a culture that enables the delivery of the Knowledge and Information Plan
Provide support in the delivery of regular reports on the annual work programme of the OoCIO and advise the Directorate on the adequate resourcing and appropriate standing of this function within the HSE.
Support to the Committees
Support to the Directorate, and its Committees, was provided by the Corporate Secretary, Mr Dara Purcell (Term of office ended 31 May 2018) and Mr Jim O’Sullivan (appointed 1 June 2018).
eHealth Committee
The Committee is not responsible for the executive functions of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OoCIO) but will exercise an advisory and assurance role in relation to its duties.
The Committee is considered to be an expert group that provides commentary to the OoCIO that enables it to learn lessons from other areas, eHealth and wider.
The Committee advises the Directorate on:
• Providing expert knowledge, guidance and networking opportunities for the OoCIO to aid it on its delivery path
That appropriate arrangements exist to deliver a governance framework which ensures a clear line of sight from high level objectives on a programmatic basis to implementation at business operational level of the content of the Knowledge and Information Plan
That the working of OoCIO is supported by strategic planning, delivery, review and assessment of service performance and strategic performance
That OoCIO is based around the provision of eHealth solutions to health delivery throughout Ireland within government policy and legislation
The promotion of a customer service culture within the operational delivery of ICT, ensuring that the OoCIO remains clinically led and with patient focus at the centre.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
The eHealth Committee met on two occasions in 2018.
During the year, the Committee received a wide range of briefings from the Chief Information Officer (CIO) on the programmes of work currently being undertaken by the OoCIO.
In addition, the Committee provided advice and guidance on a number of national programmes, for example the Children’s Hospital Programme, IT Capability Maturity Framework, Newborn and Maternal, NIMIS and the EHR Programme.
The eHealth Ireland Committee comprises individuals who have very relevant competencies to support the CIO of the HSE in implementing the strategy.
It reviews and recommends implementation strategies to the CIO, and advises the CIO and HSE Directorate on ICT investment decisions.

Statement on Internal Control
This Statement on Internal Control represents the position for the year ended 31 December 2018.
It sets out the Health Service Executive’s approach to, and responsibility for, Risk Management, Internal Controls and Governance.
Responsibility for the System of Internal Control
On behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE) I acknowledge the Directorate’s responsibility for ensuring that an effective system of internal control is maintained and operated.
This statement has been prepared in accordance with the requirement set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform’s (DPER’s) Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2016).
The Directorate of the HSE was established as the governing body of the HSE in accordance with the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013.
The Directorate is accountable to the Minister for Health for the performance of the HSE through the Director General as Chairman of the Directorate.
The Directorate of the HSE has responsibility for the HSE’s system of internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness.
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, which is due to be enacted in 2019, provides for the creation of a HSE Board and CEO governance structure.
The Bill proposes that the Board will be the governing body of the HSE, accountable to the Minister, and responsible for strengthening governance, oversight and performance.
The CEO of the HSE will be accountable to the Board.
The Bill also contains provision for the establishment of an Audit Committee and any other Committees that the Board deem as necessary.
Purpose of the System of Internal Control
The system of internal control is designed to manage and reduce risk rather than to eliminate risk and as such the review of the system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control seeks to ensure that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or detected in a timely manner.
The system of internal control is also designed to ensure appropriate protocols and policies are in place and operating effectively in the context of clinical and patient safety.
The system of internal control, which accords with guidance issued by the DEPR, has been in place in the HSE for the year ended 31 December 2018, and up to the date of approval of the financial statements, except for the control issues outlined below.
Capacity to Handle Risk
The Directorate, as the governing body of the HSE, has overall responsibility for the system of internal financial control and risk management.
The Directorate may establish committees to provide assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its duties and functions.
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 (2013 Act) provides for the establishment of an Audit Committee and any other Committees that the Directorate deem as necessary for the purpose of providing assistance and advice in relation to the performance of the Directorates functions. The HSE has an Audit Committee, which was established in January 2014, in accordance with the provisions of the 2013 Act.
The membership of the Audit Committee consists of an independent external Chairperson, four other external members and a member of the HSE Directorate.
All members have the relevant skills and experience to perform the functions of the Committee and all external members are highly experienced and qualified Finance Professionals.
The Audit Committee acts in an advisory capacity and has no executive function.
The focus of the Audit Committee in providing advice to the Directorate and the Director General is on the regularity and propriety of transactions recorded in the accounts and on the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control operated by the HSE.
The Audit Committee operates under an agreed Charter which sets out in detail the role, duties and authority of the Committee.
The Audit Committee is required to meet at least four times annually.
In 2018 the Audit Committee met on seven separate occasions and a joint meeting of the Audit and Risk Committees took place on one further occasion.
The HSE has an Internal Audit division with appropriately trained personnel operating in accordance with a written charter approved by the Audit Committee.
The National Director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee and to the Director General of the HSE and is a member of the HSE Leadership team.
The work programme of Internal Audit is agreed with the Audit Committee.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
During 2018, the Internal Audit division completed a substantial body of work as part of its annual risk based work plan, issuing 160 audit reports.
Particular focus was placed on auditing funded agencies as well as ICT audits.
The findings of these reports were considered by the HSE Audit Committee and Leadership Team.
A Risk Committee was established in 2014 in accordance with the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act, 2013.
The Risk Committee, which reports to the Directorate, has an independent external chairperson and comprises a member of the Directorate and five external members.
The Committee operates under an agreed Charter and focuses principally on assisting the Directorate in fulfilling its duties by providing an independent and objective review of non-financial risks.
The Committee kept its terms of reference and work programme under review during the year.
In 2018 the Risk Committee met on seven separate occasions.
Liaison between the Audit and Risk Committees is facilitated by an annual joint meeting of the two committees and regular engagement between the two Committee Chairs.
The HSE has developed an integrated risk management policy which clearly defines the roles and responsibilities for all levels of staff in relation to risk (financial and non- financial).
The policy is communicated across all levels of staff.
The HSE is committed to ensuring that risk management is seen as the concern of everyone, is embedded both as part of normal day to day business and informs the strategic and operational planning and performance cycle.
Management at all levels of the HSE are responsible to the Director General for the implementation and maintenance of appropriate and effective internal control in respect of their respective functions and organisations.
This embedding of responsibility for the system of internal control is designed to ensure not only that the HSE is capable of detecting and responding to control issues should they arise, with appropriate escalation protocols, but also that a culture of accountability and responsibility pertains throughout the whole organisation.
In Quarter 4 2018, informed by the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme (Scally Report), the HSE Leadership team commissioned a Risk Management Working Group to prepare proposals in relation to Risk Management in the HSE for consideration by the HSE Risk Committee, the HSE Leadership team and the incoming HSE Board.
This working group is comprised of key senior HSE Managers representing all HSE Divisions, Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), and Hospital Groups (HGs).
It is sponsored by the National Director, Quality Assurance and Verification (QAV), chaired by the Assistant National Director, Quality Risk and Safety and is supported by an external expert advisor in risk management.
The working group met on four occasions between October 2018 and March 2019 and a draft proposal document for review by management is at a late stage of completion.
The HSE has established a Healthcare audit function, which is part of the HSE’s Quality Assurance and Verification division.
The National Director of Quality Assurance and Verification reports to the Risk Committee and to the Director General, and is a member of the HSE Leadership Team.
The work programme of Healthcare audit is agreed with the Risk Committee.
During 2018, the Healthcare audit team completed 45 audits and the findings were considered by the HSE Risk Committee and Leadership Team.
The annual work programme of the Internal Audit division is co-ordinated with the work programme of the Healthcare audit function and in 2019 this will be further developed to involve joint audits.
Risk and Control Framework
The HSE has developed an Integrated Risk Management policy which has been guided by the principles of risk management outlined in ISO10 31000 (ISO 31000 is an internationally recognised standard informed by experts in the area of risk management).
This policy, and its guidance documentation, has been updated and communicated to all relevant staff during 2018.
The Quality and Patient Safety leads in service areas facilitate and support staff in the application of this policy.
The HSE’s risk management policy involves proactively identifying risks that threaten the achievement of objectives and putting in place actions to reduce these to an acceptable level.
The policy sets out the risk management processes in place and details the roles and responsibilities of staff in relation to risk.
Risk management is the responsibility of all managers and staff at all levels within the HSE.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Risk registers are in place at key levels in the organisation.
These identify the key risks facing the HSE.
Risks on these registers have been assessed and evaluated according to their significance.
At an organisational level the Corporate Risk Register is subject to monitoring and updating on a quarterly basis.
The risk registers set out the existing controls, the risk rating and any additional controls required to mitigate each risk and assigns both persons and timescales for completion of these.
An aspect of the quarterly monitoring process is to monitor the completion of additional controls required and to re-evaluate the risk based on this.
The responsibility for the management of claims from clinical and operational incidents under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) and General Indemnity Scheme (GIS) has been delegated to the State Claims Agency (SCA) under statute.
The SCA also provides specialist advice, including risk management advice, to the HSE which is supported by the electronic national incident management reporting system NIMS.
The HSE has in place an internal control framework which is monitored to ensure that there is an effective culture of internal control.
The HSE’s Code of Governance is set out on www.hse.ie and includes the following: •
The Code of Governance reflects the current behavioural standards, policies and procedures to be applied within and by the HSE, and the agencies it funds to provide services on its behalf.
The Performance and Accountability Framework describes in detail the means by which managers in the health service, including those in Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups (HGs) will be held to account for performance in relation to service provision, quality and patient safety, finance and workforce.
There is a framework of administrative procedures in place including segregation of duties, a system of delegation and accountability, a system for the authorisation of expenditure and regular management reporting.
The HSE’s National Financial Regulations form an integral part of the system of internal control and have been designed to be consistent with statutory requirements and to also ensure compliance with public sector guidelines issued by the DEPR.
The HSE has in place a devolved annual budgetary system and each year the Minister for Health formally approves the annual service plan.
Defined accountability limits are set which are closely monitored by the National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) on behalf of the Director General.
The HSE has in place a wide range of written policies, procedures, protocols and guidelines in relation to operational and financial controls.
The HSE carries out an annual comprehensive review of the system of internal control, details of which are covered in a later section of this report.
There are systems and controls aimed at ensuring the security of the information and communication technology systems within the HSE.
This is an area of high priority for the HSE given the challenges of managing multiple systems across the entire HSE.
There are on-going developments to improve security and to ensure that the HSE has the appropriate level of resource and skills to protect the integrity of its systems to ensure that data and information is protected.
Additionally an annual Controls Assurance Statement (CAS) must be completed by all senior management.
This statement requires management to confirm that they are aware of and comply with the key financial controls and the Code of Governance in place within the HSE.
5. Procurement
The HSE has procedures in place to ensure compliance with current procurement rules and guidelines.
In procuring goods and services, all areas within the HSE must comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE’s National Financial Regulations.
Matters arising regarding controls over procurement are highlighted under the heading internal control issues.
6. On-going Monitoring and
Review
Formal procedures have been established for monitoring control processes and control deficiencies are communicated to those responsible for taking corrective action and to the Directorate and senior management.
I confirm that the following on-going monitoring systems are in place: •
Key risks and related controls have been identified and processes have been put in place to monitor the operation of those key controls and report any identified deficiencies.
Reporting arrangements have been established at all levels where responsibility for financial management has been assigned
There are regular reviews by senior management of periodic and annual performance and financial reports indicating HSE performance against budgets/forecasts
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
There are regular reviews by the DoH of the HSE’s performance in terms of budget and service plans as well as including other key non-financial reporting such as workforce planning.
The National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) has delegated authority from the Director General to serve as a key performance and accountability oversight and scrutiny process for the HSE and to support the Director General and the Directorate in overseeing and driving the performance of the HSE’s divisions.
The work of Internal Audit forms an important part of the monitoring of the internal control system within the HSE.
The annual work plan of Internal Audit is informed by analysis of the key risks to which the HSE is exposed and is approved by the Audit Committee.
The National Director of Internal Audit attends all Audit Committee meetings and has regular one to one meetings with the Chairperson of the Audit Committee as well as the Director General.
Monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the HSE’s internal controls is also informed by the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG).
Comments and recommendations made by the C&AG in his management letters, audit certificates or annual reports, are reviewed by the Directorate and Leadership Team and actions are taken to implement recommendations.
Review of their implementation is monitored by NPOG, on behalf of the Directorate, with input from the Audit Committee.
In addition, a National Financial Controls Assurance Group (NFCAG) was also established in 2015 in order to address a number of recurring control weaknesses identified as part of the annual audit of the financial statements and by internal audit and other external reviews.
Since 2015 this group has focused on addressing issues in relation to procurement, taxation, prompt payment interest, pay-related overpayments and cash handling.
This group reports to NPOG.
Annually the HSE requires all relevant senior staff at Grade VIII (or equivalent) and above to complete an internal control questionnaire which is designed to provide essential feedback in respect of key control and risk areas.
This allows the HSE to monitor the effectiveness of key controls and to direct remediation activity where required.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control
I confirm that the HSE has procedures to monitor the effectiveness of its risk management and control procedures.
The HSE’s monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the Internal and External Auditors, the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and senior management within HSE responsible for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework.
I confirm that the HSE conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the Internal Controls for 2018 which took into consideration: •
Audit Committee and Risk Committee minutes/reports
Recommendations from internal audit reports
Findings arising from the Internal Control Questionnaire
Status of the recommendations of previous years’ reports on the Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control
Recommendations from management letters of the C&AG
The 2018 audit programme of the C&AG and in particular, the audit risks identified therein
Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts
HSE Directorate and Leadership Team minutes
Minutes of steering group/working group/ implementation groups, etc.
External reviews undertaken by the HSE to assist in identifying financial control issues and implementing revised policies and business processes
HSE corporate risk register
Findings and reports arising from the work of the National Financial Controls Assurance Group (NFCAG).
Feedback from the HSE's healthcare audit function.
The report on the review of the system of internal control has been considered by the Audit and Risk Committees and by the Directorate of the HSE.
Financial Governance
The results of the review indicate there is evidence that: •
The HSE has adopted a suite of internal policies and procedures, which form the basis of the internal control framework
Where high level risks have been identified, mitigating/ compensating controls are generally in place
Many instances of non-compliance with these adopted policies and procedures have been identified exposing the organisation to material risk
Awareness of the requirement for internal controls and accountability has increased during 2018 with the number of staff who completed the ICQ survey increasing significantly by circa 26%.
It is clear from the responses received that most managers indicate high levels of compliance with internal controls.
However the lack of uniform consistency of responses again noted in 2018 indicates on-going varying levels of compliance in many control areas.
This information will be used in 2019 to focus work on increasing compliance with specific controls and to raise general awareness of the requirement for compliance with all controls
Reasonable assurance can be placed on the current system of internal control to mitigate and/or manage key inherent risks to which financial activities are exposed.
However a significant number of weaknesses exist in the HSE’s internal financial controls as evidenced by the number of breaches that occur.
Improvements in these areas will continue to receive significant focus from the HSE Leadership Team in the coming years.
In summary, notwithstanding the control weaknesses which were identified and are being addressed by management, including as set out below under section 8 Internal Control Issues, satisfactory levels of compliance with the control framework are generally observed by the majority of staff.
To support this, a new and developing Financial Management Framework has been drafted which defines the process, governance and controls required to demonstrate effective financial management practice.
The National Reporting Strategy, which is a key element of the Financial Management Framework, is a significant piece of work currently underway.
This strategy seeks to ensure that accurate financial information can be readily accessed to deliver better planning and delivery of services.
Preparatory work is underway in the Programme (including the appointment of a Systems Integrator) for the commencement of the detailed design, build and test of the IFMS which will commence in Q4 2019.
IFMS will be deployed in two phases across the entire publicly funded health system commencing in Q4 2020.
Compliance •
Finalisation of a 3-year Compliance Improvement Plan 2017-2020 in Q4 2016, which addresses identified non-compliance issues.
Currently, a compliance improvement programme is being implemented in a systematic manner across selected CHOs and HGs working in conjunction with HBS Procurement.
Development of an online procurement compliance report which provides detail of non-compliance to Service areas.
This report is currently in use but is not yet fully populated for the entire HSE area.
Once fully developed this report will be used to both identify noncompliance and as a benchmark monitoring tool as part of the Compliance Improvement Plan roll-out.
Development of a digital Corporate Procurement Planning (CPP) toolset which will be available to each HG and CHO on-line.
This online tool is expected to provide bespoke analysis and information such as procurement activity, expenditure which is greater than €25K, compliance levels and savings.
The HSE has continued to progress a number of initiatives in 2018 organised around three key themes:
Sourcing
Health Business Service (HBS) Procurement have developed a three-year Sourcing Plan (2016-2019) for the HSE which has the explicit aim of putting in place contracts for all procurable goods and services required by the HSE.
Currently there are central contracts in place covering annual expenditure of circa €1bn.
Key components of this Sourcing Plan relate to: • •
On-going development of the Procurement Project Management System (PPMS) which will support HSE staff with progressing procurement.
Development of the Data Warehouse System to provide visibility of product data and usage including price comparison across legacy systems.
These systems and the on-going stabilisation project will assist budget holders and HBS Procurement in identifying areas where greater efficiencies can be achieved and support compliance with procurement regulations.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
The HSE’s governance framework is consistent with the management and accountability arrangements for grants from Exchequer funding as set out in the instructionissued by DPER in September 2014, with one sanctioned exception in respect of prefunding arrangements.
Due to the specific nature of the funding arrangements with the S38 and S39 organisations the HSE must continue to ensure timely funding particularly in respect of contractual pay and staffing costs which account for up to 80% of expenditure and for which the requirements of the circular are impractical.
Before entering into any funding arrangement the HSE determines the maximum amount of funding that it proposes to make available along with the level of service to be provided for that funding.
For the larger agencies, cash is disbursed by the HSE's treasury unit based on agreed cash profiles.
The system of internal financial control operating in individual funded agencies is subject to review on a sample basis by the HSE’s Internal Audit division and by external audits conducted by the Office of the C&AG.
The audit of the C&AG examined a sample of 63 agencies allocated funding of €500 million across two CHOs.
53 of these agencies (including two for profit agencies) were funded under a Service Arrangement valued at greater than €250k and ten were managed under a Grant Aid Agreement, valued at less than €250k.
As part of that examination, the audit identified control weaknesses relating to the monitoring and oversight of agencies in receipt of exchequer funding.
These findings are consistent with the findings of the HSE’s Internal Audit division during their own internal audit programme of work in respect of funded agencies during 2018.
In addition, the requirement to submit financial reports and staffing returns and to hold monitoring meetings is dependent on the size of the agency.
During 2018, there were weaknesses identified by the HSE’s annual internal control review, via the Controls Assurance Review process, particularly in the application of processes relating to monitoring and oversight of some agencies.
The HSE has two types of contractual agreements with these agencies that are, in the main, tailored to reflect the level of funding in place.
Service Arrangement (SA), health agencies in receipt of funding in excess of €250,000
Grant Aid Agreement (GA), health agencies in receipt of funding of less than €250,000
External and internal audits have found that: •
• Monitoring meetings have not been conducted at the frequency required in accordance with the HSE guidelines in a significant number of the cases reviewed. •
There was a lack of evidence that required financial performance data, such as management accounts and activity data, was submitted at the required frequency in a significant proportion of cases, in particular with respect to S39’s.
These initiatives have enabled the HSE, to a reasonable extent, to be satisfied that there are appropriate governance structures and procedures in place with these service providers.
Agencies which do not sign the SA in accordance with the requirements of the current policy are subject to a withholding of 20% of funding, which has improved compliance rates.
At the end of 2018, 95% (2017: 96%) of funding was covered by a completed SA/ GA
These returns are circulated at regular intervals to the national divisions, Chief Officers of the CHOs and CEOs of the HGs for their necessary attention.
Briefing sessions on the governance framework for both HSE staff and staff from agencies were held in all CHOs in November and December 2018.
The objective of these briefing sessions was to reinforce, in advance of the completion of SAs and GAs for 2019, the key elements of the governance framework in terms of the completion of relevant documentation and the associated processes.
Annual Compliance Statements are required from all section 38 agencies (circa 75% of total funding) and section 39 agencies in receipt of over €3 million (circa 17% of total funding).
The Annual Financial Monitoring Return (AFMR) which provides for the requirements of DPER Circular 13/2014 and which includes an assurance statement on compliance with key financial governance, is completed by all agencies managed by a service arrangement (circa 98% of total funding).
The AMFRs are reviewed in each service area, CHO and HG by relevant staff as appropriate.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
The HSE plans to establish Contract Management Support Units (CMSUs) in each of the nine CHOs.
The CMSUs will be a key resource within the CHOs in terms of enhancing the level of management and oversight in respect of section 38 and section 39 agencies funded by the CHOs.
Phase 1 entails setting up pilot sites in four CHOs and an implementation team has been set up in this regard.
The HSE’s Compliance Unit will continue to act in an advisory and support role during the implementation of this initiative.
The HSE will seek additional resources to ensure CMSUs are set up in all CHOs.
In 2016, the HSE commenced an External Review of Governance at Board and Executive level in certain section 38 agencies.
At 13 May 2019, 23 of these reviews have been completed and the remaining six are underway.
However all Chairs of the Boards of each of these agencies have received either a final report or a draft report to consider.
An overall composite report will be completed which will highlight key issues identified in these reviews.
Each review contains management responses with regard to recommendations set out in the reviews and a follow up process has been established in this regard.
The HSE plans to commence a rolling review programme in 2019 to include large section 39 agencies as well as additional section 38 agencies.
These reviews would expect to draw from and build upon on the work being completed in the current external review process.
A five year cycle is envisaged with eight agencies being reviewed annually.
The HSE’s Compliance Unit have in 2018 carried out a limited review of service arrangements, grant aid agreements and related documentation in two CHOs.
A report is being prepared and the learning from this review will be used to inform the work plans of the CMSUs.
Some of the larger section 38 and section 39 agencies have themselves used the outputs of the Annual Compliance Statement, Annual Financial Monitoring Return and the external reviews, to implement their own initiatives to enhance their Governance at Board level.
In relation to the weaknesses identified in the area of procurement, HBS continues to work with and provide on-going support to the section 38 and section 39 agencies.
All agencies receiving annual funding in excess of €150k have been provided with online access to the HBS Pricing and Assisted Sourcing System (PASS).
This provides access for these agencies to the HBS/OGP contracts and Framework Agreements.
A Corporate Procurement Plan Guidance for Health Agencies has been finalised and has been communicated along with training by HBS Procurement
On-going review of audit findings relating to the governance of grants to outside agencies is a priority for the HSE and there are established processes in place for following up on internal audit as well as external audit findings (local management and national management letters).
Information Communication Technology (ICT)
The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OoCIO) delivers and manages a full range of ICT services throughout the HSE and in part of the voluntary acute sector.
The HSE have a base of over 50,000 users using approximately 1,400 applications and over 1,000 networked sites.
In addition, the OoCIO provide a range of national applications to the acute voluntary sector and indirectly supports their user base.
There are approximately 380 ICT projects currently being progressed, of which about 50 are large multi-annual programmes or projects.
The OoCIO currently has 318 staff, a revenue budget of €42.69m and a capital budget of €85m.
Internal audits have identified weaknesses in the area of security controls across parts of the domain including application password protocols and the management of secure access.
Weaknesses have been acknowledged in some of the areas audited in disaster recovery protocols, particularly in relation to older and legacy systems.
The OoCIO is committed to improving controls in respect of cyber security.
The OoCIO has a number of programmes underway to manage these weaknesses across our large domain.
These include the One ID programme, the single sign-on programme, infrastructure upgrades, and the upgrading of application software which will, over time, provide a means for the following: •
Single logon to domains and applications which ensures that all staff have unique and safe access to the domains and applications
Single email platform to improve cross regional communication and collaboration
Financial Governance
Upgraded infrastructure with modern security features
Upgraded applications and database technology
Migration to One ID has commenced and will continue to be rolled out during 2019 across CHOs, HGs and HBS, as well as central divisions.
Further, the HSE’s Internal Audit division in collaboration with external specialist ICT audit support will continue to conduct targeted audits on a risk management basis.
It is also encouraging to note that this review indicates a growing awareness of the importance of improved accountability and responsibility at all levels of HSE staff, and stronger engagement with the controls assurance process for 2018.
The Directorate acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for the system of internal control within the HSE and will continue to monitor and support further development of controls.
Progress will be reassessed in the 2019 Review of the Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control.
Risk Management
As a result of issues identified by the Scally Report in the area of risk management, the HSE has established a working group, as detailed in section 3 of this statement.
The groups mandate is to prepare proposals in relation to risk management in the HSE, for consideration by the incoming HSE Board, HSE Risk Committee and the HSE Leadership team.
Chairperson 13 May 2019
It is expected that the work of this group will be completed during Q3 2019.
The report on the Review of Effectiveness of the System of Internal Control in the HSE has been considered by the HSE Directorate and reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committees.
The HSE is an organisation undergoing significant change and its control systems still rely on the legacy financial systems of the former health bodies it replaced.
These legacy systems will be replaced on a phased basis, over the next 3-5 years, with a single national integrated financial and procurement system, as part of the finance reform programme which is underway.
The issues in respect to non-compliance identified within the HSE control environment referenced in this statement, underline the need for specific and sustained focus on improvement and compliance at all levels of the organisation.
As evidenced by the HSE’s own review of internal controls, notwithstanding the control breaches which have been identified and which are being addressed by management as set out above in section 7, satisfactory levels of compliance with the control framework are generally observed by the majority of staff.

Comptroller and Auditor General Report for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas Health Service Executive
Opinion on the financial statements
I have audited the financial statements of the Health Service Executive for the year ending 31 December 2018 as required under the provisions of Section 36 of the Health Act 2004.
The financial statements comprise •
the statement of revenue income and expenditure
the statement of capital income and expenditure
the statement of financial position
the statement of changes in reserves
the statement of cash flows and
the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In my opinion, the financial statements •
properly present the state of the Health Service Executive’s affairs at 31 December 2018 and its income and expenditure for 2018
have been properly prepared in accordance with the accounting standards specified by the Minister for Health as set out in the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies.
Basis of the opinion I conducted my audit of the financial statements in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as promulgated by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
My responsibilities under those standards are described in the appendix to this report.
I am independent of the Health Service Executive and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the standards.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
The Minister has issued an additional derogation for 2018, in respect of the non-recognition of a liability arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants which was agreed in June 2018.
The circumstances giving rise to this exception and the financial effect are set out in Notes 6 and 26 to the financial statements.
My audit opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Reporting on information other than the financial statements, and on other matters The Health Service Executive has presented certain other information together with the financial statements.
This comprises the annual report including the governance statement and Directorate members’ report, and the statement on internal control.
My responsibilities to report in relation to such information, and on certain other matters upon which I report by exception, are described in the appendix to this report.
Non-compliance with procurement rules The Health Service Executive is still not in a position to quantify the value of its expenditure on goods and services where the procedures employed did not comply with procurement guidelines.
Based on sample testing, my audit identified a significant level of non-compliant procurement that is consistent with findings in previous years.
There was non-compliance in relation to 30% (by value) of a sample of payments examined at five Health Service Executive locations visited by the audit.
The total value of the sample was €66.1 million.
The statement on internal control sets out the steps being taken by the Executive to address its non-compliance with procurement rules.
However, the Executive acknowledges that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.
Emphasis of matter
Note 1 to the financial statements sets out the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements.
These include a number of exceptions to generally accepted accounting principles which the Minister has directed are to be applied by the Health Service Executive.
Comptroller and Auditor General 13 May 2019
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Appendix to the Report
Responsibilities of Directorate members
The governance statement and Directorate members’ report sets out the Directorate members’ responsibilities.
The members are responsible for •
the preparation of financial statements in the form prescribed under section 36 of the Health Act 2004 and accounting standards specified by the Minister for Health
ensuring the regularity of transactions
assessing whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General
I am required under Section 36 of the Health Act 2004 to audit the financial statements of the Health Service Executive and to report thereon to the Houses of the Oireachtas.
My objective in carrying out the audit is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
In doing so, •
I identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
I obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls.
I evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures.
I conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, on whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Health Service Executive’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.
My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Health Service Executive to cease to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other matters
My audit is conducted by reference to the special considerations which attach to State bodies in relation to their management and operation.
I report if I identify material matters relating to the manner in which public business has been conducted.
I seek to obtain evidence about the regularity of financial transactions in the course of audit.
I report if I identify any material instance where public money has not been applied for the purposes intended or where transactions did not conform to the authorities governing them.
I also report by exception if, in my opinion, •
I have not received all the information and explanations I required for my audit, or
the accounting records were not sufficient to permit the financial statements to be readily and properly audited, or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records.

Chairperson
Chief Financial Officer
Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis, in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Under Section 36(3) of the Health Act 2004, the Minister specifies the accounting standards to be followed by the HSE.
The HSE has adopted Irish and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), FRS 102, in accordance with accounting standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council subject to the following exceptions specified by the Minister:
1. Depreciation is not charged to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure, rather it is charged against the Capitalisation (Reserve) Account balance.
Under GAAP, depreciation must be charged in the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure.
2. Capital grants received from the State to fund the purchase of property, plant and equipment are recorded in the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure.
Under GAAP, capital grants are recorded as deferred income and amortised over the useful life of related property, plant and equipment, in order to match the accounting treatment of the grant against the related depreciation charge.
Capital expenditure in relation to assets, other than those purchased by way of service concession arrangement, are recognised in the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure as incurred.
Under FRS 102, such expenditure is capitalised and charged to income and expenditure over the life of the asset.
3. Pensions are accounted for on a ‘pay as-you go’ basis.
The provisions of FRS 102 ‘Section 28: Employee Benefits’ are not applied and the liability for future pension benefits accrued in the year has not been recognised in the financial statements.
4. Claims under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme which are paid by the HSE, and administered by the State Claims Agency on the HSE’s behalf, are accounted for on a ‘pay as-you go’ basis.
This does not comply with FRS 102 ‘Section 21 – Provisions and Contingencies’.
Details of the amount recognised in the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure in 2018, together with the actuarially estimated future liability attaching to this scheme at 31 December 2018, are set out in Note 11.
Going Concern
The Directorate assumes that all existing HSE activities will therefore continue and that, as there is a continuance of the activity of the entity, the financial statements for 2018 continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
Income Recognition
Department of Health Revenue and Capital Grant Monies to fund the health service are voted to the Department of Health (DoH) (Vote 38).
The DoH provides grants to the HSE in respect of administration, capital and non-capital services.
Section 33(1) of the Health Act 2004, as amended provides that each year the Minister will issue a Letter of Determination to the HSE setting out the maximum expenditure it may incur in the relevant financial year.
The final Letter of Determination in relation to 2018 was received on 23 January 2019.
In accordance with the accounting standards prescribed by the Minister, the HSE accounts for grants on an accruals basis.
Accordingly, the amount specified in the Letter of Determination for the relevant financial year is recognised as income in that year.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Grant income in respect of administration and non-capital services is accounted for: •
in the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure where it is applied to non-capital areas of expenditure;
in the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure under the heading ‘Revenue Funding Applied to Capital Projects’ where non-capital grant monies is used to fund capital expenditure.
Grant income in respect of capital services is accounted for in the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure.
Section 33(3) of the Health Act 2004, as amended, requires the HSE to manage and deliver services in a manner that is in accordance with an approved Service Plan and within the determination notified by the Minister.
The Act provides for any deficits to be charged to income and expenditure in the next financial year and, subject to the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), for surpluses to be credited to income and expenditure in the next financial year.
Other Income
Lease incentives are recognised over the lease term on a straight line basis.
At initial recognition, a finance lease liability is also recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
(iii) Income from all other sources is recognised when received.
Grants to Outside Agencies
Capital Grants
The HSE funds a number of service providers and bodies for the provision of health and personal social services on its behalf, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.
Before entering into such an arrangement, the HSE determines the maximum amount of funding that it proposes to make available in the financial year under the arrangement and the level of service it expects to be provided for that funding.
This accounting treatment, which does not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, is a consequence of the exceptions to generally accepted accounting principles specified by the Minister.
Leases HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Property, Plant and Equipment and Capitalisation Account
Valuation – Property, Plant and Equipment comprise Land, Buildings, Work in Progress, Equipment and Motor Vehicles.
The carrying values of assets taken over from predecessor bodies by the HSE were included in the opening balance sheet on establishment day, 1 January 2005, at their original cost/valuation.
The related aggregate depreciation account balance was also included in the opening Statement of Financial Position.
On establishment of the HSE, land of predecessor bodies was included at valuation based on rates per hectare/square metre supplied by the Department of Health and Children following consultation with the Valuation Office.
These valuations were last updated in 2002.
The HSE continues to value land taken over from predecessor bodies using these rates.
It should be noted that lands owned by the HSE are held for the provision of health and personal social services.
Property, plant and equipment additions since 1 January 2005 are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Capital Expenditure Recognition – In accordance with the accounting standards prescribed by the Minister, expenditure on property, plant and equipment additions is charged to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure or the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure, depending on whether the asset is funded by capital or revenue funding.
Capitalisation Policy – Capital funded assets and revenue funded assets are capitalised if the cost exceeds certain value thresholds: €2,000 for computer equipment and €7,000 for all other asset classes.
Asset additions below this threshold and funded from revenue are written off in the year of purchase.
Asset additions below this threshold funded from capital are included in Note 13(b) under ‘Expenditure on HSE projects not resulting in Property, Plant and Equipment additions’.
A breakdown of asset additions by funding source is provided in Note 13(a) to the accounts.
Primary Care Centres acquired under Public Private Partnership (PPP) service concession arrangements are capitalised and accounted for using the finance lease liability model.
The value of the Primary Care Centre asset and the service concession liability is recognised as assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
Future minimum lease payments are calculated from the unitary charge payments set out in the contract, to be made directly by the HSE.
The property elements of the unitary charge plus any reliably measured capital element of operational payments are used as the basis of the future minimum lease payments.
PPP service concession arrangements are accounted for in the HSE's accounts using the Capital Investment Approach.
This provides for the accumulation of capital value reflecting the State’s equity in PPP property assets.
Using this approach, the PPP capital commitment is recognised in the Capitalisation (Reserve) Account at an amount equal to the related finance lease liability.
Over the life of the concession, the reduction in the outstanding finance lease liability is amortised annually through the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure with the corresponding entry to the Capitalisation (Reserve) Account.
Depreciation – In accordance with the accounting standards specified by the Minister for Health, depreciation is not charged to the Statement of Income and Expenditure over the useful life of the asset.
Instead, a Statement of Financial Position reserve account, the Capitalisation Account, is the reciprocal entry to Property, Plant and Equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Property, Plant and Equipment and Capitalisation Accounts over the useful economic life of the asset.
Assets are not depreciated where they have been acquired or are managed under PPP service concession agreements which guarantee residual useful lives and operating capacity at the end of the concession term that would be equivalent to that of the asset when it was first commissioned.
Other fixed assets, where subject to depreciation, are depreciated for a full year in the year of acquisition.
Residual value represents the estimated amount which would currently be obtained from disposal of an asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of an age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Depreciation on all other property, plant and equipment is calculated to write-off the original cost/valuation of each asset over its useful economic life on a straight line basis at the following rates: •
Land: land is not depreciated.
Buildings: depreciated at 2.5% per annum.
Modular buildings (i.e. prefabricated buildings): depreciated at 10% per annum.
Work in progress: no depreciation.
Equipment – computers and ICT systems: depreciated at 33.33% per annum.
Equipment – other: depreciated at 10% per annum.
Motor vehicles: depreciated at 20% per annum.
On disposal of fixed assets, both the Property, Plant and Equipment and Capitalisation Accounts are reduced by the net book value of the asset disposal.
An analysis of the movement on the Capitalisation Account is provided in the Statement of Changes in Reserves.
The Multi-Annual Delegated Capital sanction 2015-2018 was issued in December 2015 by DPER.
The Letter of Sanction 2018 for Capital provides for an allowance to re-invest proceeds of sale of fixed assets of up to €6 million in 2018 (2017: €4 million).
Public Private Partnerships Service Concession Agreements Service charge elements of the unitary charge payments are expensed in the Statement of Capital Income and Expenditure. Obligations to make payments of an operational nature are disclosed in Note 22 to the financial statements. Pensions
(i) Superannuation paid to retired HSE employees is accounted for within the pay classification (see Note 6); (ii) Superannuation paid to retirees from the voluntary health service providers is accounted for under grants to outside agencies within the non-pay classification (see Note 8 and Appendix 1). The HSE has entered into a PPP or service concession agreement with a private sector entity to design, build, finance and maintain infrastructure assets for a specified period of time (concession period).
This is a single PPP contract for the delivery of fourteen Primary Care Centres (PCCs).
Contributions from HSE employees who are members of the schemes are credited to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure when received. Contributions from employees of the voluntary health service providers who are members of the scheme are retained as income of the health service provider.
No provision has been made in respect of pension benefits earned by employees and payable in future years under the pension scheme, consistent with the accounting treatment in previous years.
The contract entered into is on an availability basis and is for a 25 year service period from the date of service commencement for each PCC. It is payable by way of an annual unitary charge.
The unitary charge is subject to deductions for periods when the assets are unavailable for use.
The asset value is recognised in the 2018 AFS at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
The Public Service (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 introduced the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme (“Single Scheme”) which commenced with effect from 1 January 2013.
All new staff members to the Health Service Executive, who are new entrants to the Public Sector, on or after 1 January 2013 are members of the Single Scheme.
Single Scheme member contributions are paid over to DPER.
Financial Governance
Pension Related Deduction
Accrued Holiday Pay
Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, a pension levy was introduced for all staff who are members of a public service pension scheme, including staff of certain HSE funded service providers.
Pension levy collected by service providers as well as pension levy deducted from HSE staff is accounted for as income by the HSE.
Details of amount deducted in respect of the pension levy are set out in Note 5(a) to the Financial Statements.
Salaries, wages and employment related benefits are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees.
The cost of leave earned but not taken by employees at the end of the financial year is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry forward unpaid annual leave into the following year.
Due to different payroll systems across the HSE it was necessary to make assumptions in order to calculate the accrual.
The assumptions underlying the holiday pay accrual, for which amounts are recognised in the financial statements, are determined (including employee profiles and the pattern of holidays taken) based on current conditions.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less costs to be incurred in the sale of inventory.
The HSE historically carries a provision against specific vaccine inventories, and any other write offs and adjustments for obsolescence are charged in the current year against revenue income and expenditure.
Patients’ Private Property
Monies received for safe-keeping by the HSE from or on behalf of patients are kept in special accounts separate and apart from the HSE’s own accounts.
Such accounts are collectively called Patients’ Private Property accounts.
The HSE is responsible for the administration of these accounts.
However, as this money is not the property of the HSE, these accounts are not included on the HSE’s Statement of Financial Position.
The HSE acts as trustee of the funds.
Patients’ Private Property accounts are independently audited each year.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates
In line with FRS 102, the effective interest rate is used to discount the future construction related liabilities arising from concession agreements.
The HSE selected a discount rate of 3.32% after consultation with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on the basis that it reflects an appropriate rate for long term infrastructure assets.
The Directorate have reviewed the asset lives and associated residual values of the Primary Care Centres and have concluded that the asset lives and residual values are appropriate.

See Note 8 and Appendix 1.
Superannuation
Eligible staff employed in the HSE are members of a variety of defined benefit superannuation schemes.
Superannuation entitlements (i.e. pensions) of retired staff are paid out of current income and are charged to income and expenditure in the year in which they become payable.
In accordance with a Directive from the Minister for Health, no provision is made in the financial statements in respect of future pension benefits and no charge is made to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure in respect of this.
Superannuation contributions from employees who are members of these schemes are credited to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure when received.
No formal actuarial valuations of the HSE’s pension liabilities are carried out.
The Pension charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure for 2018 was €728m (2017: €686m), which included payments in respect of once-off lump sums and gratuity payments on retirement of €128m (2017: €115m).

Additional Analysis – Department of Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014 requirement The number of HSE employees whose total employee benefits (including basic pay, allowances, overtime, night duty, weekends, on-call, arrears and excluding employer PRSI, employer pension costs) for the reporting period fell within each band of €10,000 from €60,000 upwards are as follows: Pay Band (Number of Staff)
Total HSE employees
The HSE does not have an integrated payroll system and this disclosure which is required by DPER circular 13/2014 has therefore been prepared from multiple payroll systems across HSE areas. * 
The table above reports that one member of HSE staff received a payment in the banding between €970k and €980k.
This is not a payment for salary earned in 2017 as it incorporates backdated arrears of pay since 2010 including basic pay, allowance, overtime, night duty, weekend and on calls.
This employee is a senior clinical staff member whose actual employee benefits for 2017 would have fallen within the pay banding €210k to €220k.
All backdated payments are as per HSE consolidated pay scales.

Note 9 The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides the legislative basis for the repayment of what has been referred to as ‘long stay charges’, which were incorrectly levied on persons with full medical card eligibility prior to 14 July 2005.
The scheme allows for the repayment of charges to the following people: •
Living people who were wrongly charged at any time since 1976
The estates of people who were wrongly charged and died on or after 9 December 1998
A special account was set up which is funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas and from which repayments are made.
An amount of €2m was set aside in 2018 for this purpose.
The majority of this funding refers to a provision for payments that will arise as a result of follow-on claims and offer acceptances.
The best estimate of the total cost of repayments, at the inception of the scheme, based on the terms as set out in the Act was up to €1bn.
Repayments were expected to be made to approximately 20,000 living patients and to the estates of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 deceased former patients.
The scheme closed to new applicants on 31 December 2007 and nearly 14,000 claims have been received in respect of living patients and nearly 27,000 claims in respect of estates.
Up to 31 December 2018, 20,299 claims were paid.
As at December 2018, there were no outstanding claims being processed to offer stage under the scheme.
€2m has been provided in the HSE’s 2019 budget to fund repayments for outstanding claims and associated administrative costs.
The cumulative total expenditure of the scheme (including administrative costs) to 31 December 2018 is €485.690m.

Note 10 The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006
The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006 established a statutory scheme to address insurance difficulties experienced by persons infected with Hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of blood and blood products.
This scheme addresses the problems faced by these persons due to their inability to purchase mortgage protection and life assurance policies as a result of contaminated blood products being administered to them.
The scheme will cover the insurance risk for the 1,700 or more people entitled to avail of assurance products, regardless of any other medical conditions these people may have, once they pay the standard premium that an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay.
The life assurance element of the scheme was launched by the HSE in September 2007.
A further element, providing for travel insurance cover, was introduced in March 2009.
The overall cost over the lifetime of the scheme was originally estimated at €90m.
The cumulative expenditure on the insurance scheme to 31 December 2018 was €10.3m.
In 2018, the following expenditure has been charged to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure in respect of the Insurance Scheme: 2018 €’000
Payments of premium loadings
Payments of benefits underwritten by HSE
Office Expenses*
* All expenditure in relation to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006 is included in HSE expenditure. ** These costs are included in the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme Special Account.
Other Hepatitis C Costs are included in the Hepatitis C Special Account and the Hepatitis C Reparation Account.
Note 11 State Claims Agency Since 1 July 2009, the HSE is funded for claims processed by the State Claims Agency under the terms of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.
From 1 January 2010, the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Functions) Order 2009 extended the State indemnity to personal injury and third party property damage claims against the HSE.
Awards paid to claimants under the terms of the scheme are accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The State Claims Agency’s best current estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving each claim, includes all foreseeable costs such as settlement amounts, plaintiff legal costs and defence costs such as fees payable to counsel, consultants, etc.
In 2018, the charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure was €318.7m (2017: €283.2m).
Based on actuarial estimates, the charge to the Statement of Revenue Income and Expenditure is expected to increase significantly in future years.
In accordance with the directions of the Minister for Health, no provision has been made for this liability in the financial statements.
The estimated liability is revised on a regular basis in light of any new information received, for example past trends in settlement amounts and legal costs.
At 31 December 2018, the estimated liability incurred to that date under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme and State indemnity was €2,792m (2017: €2,354m).
Of this €2,792m, approximately €2,332m relates to active claims in respect of clinical care, with the balance of the estimated liability relating to non-clinical care claims.
Active claims are those that have been notified to the State Claims Agency through legal process and that have not yet concluded as at the reporting date.

Note 12 Long-Term Residential Care (incorporating Nursing Homes Support Scheme/Fair Deal) The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal) commenced in 2009 and phases out the former Nursing Homes Subvention Scheme and the ‘contract beds’ system for older persons.
Under the scheme, people who need long term residential care services have their income and assets assessed, and then contribute up to 80% of assessable income and up to 7.5% of the value of the assets they own towards the cost of their care.
The HSE pays the balance, if any, of the costs of their care in both public and registered private nursing homes covered under the scheme.

NHSS recipient contributions for those patients in public homes amounted to €61.128m (2017: €60.483m) and are included in the HSE Financial Statements – Revenue Income & Expenditure Account.
NHSS recipient contributions for those patients in voluntary centres (S38 Organisations) amounted to €6.669m (2017: €7.435m), is retained by those centres and does not constitute income for the HSE.
Additional Income
Under Section 27 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 a Schedule of Assets must be submitted to the HSE in respect of a deceased person who received financial support under the Scheme.
This is checked to identify and calculate any overpayment of financial support that is repayable to the HSE pursuant to Section 42 of the Act.
The HSE collected income of €6.579m during 2018 (2017: €5.146m) in respect of non-declared income and assets of Fair Deal clients.
Contract beds, Subvention beds In 2018, payments of €20.1m (2017: €25.6m) were made in relation to contract beds and nursing home subvention.
These schemes are being phased out having had no new entrants since the Nursing Homes Support Scheme began in 2009.
Expenditure within public facilities Within the public homes in 2018 there was an additional €23.122m (2017: €19.623m) of costs relating to long term care.
These costs related to fixed unit costs and other costs incurred which were in excess of the reimbursed ‘money follows the patient’ rate paid under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018
Financial Governance
Cost of Public Nursing Homes In 2018, the cost of public nursing homes amounted to €354.67m (2017: €340.04m), these costs are gross and the client contribution element amounted to €61.13m (2017: € 60.48m).
The contributions are recognised as income in Long Stay Charges in Statement of Income and Expenditure.
Ancillary State Support
Ancillary State Support is an optional extra feature of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme for people who own property or assets in the State.
Instead of a person paying their assessed contribution for care from their own resources, a person can choose to apply for a Nursing Home Loan, to cover the portion of their contribution, which is based on property or land-based assets within the State.
The HSE then pays that portion of the cost of care on top of the State Support payment.
The loan is paid back to the State following the occurrence of a relevant event e.g. sale of the asset or death of the person.
Repayment of the loan is made to the Revenue Commissioners.
In certain cases, repayment of the loan can be deferred.
This part of the scheme is designed to protect people from having to sell their home during their lifetime.
The total gross amount of Ancillary State Support advised to Revenue as at 31 December 2018 for recoupment from the commencement of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (where a relevant and non-relevant event has occurred) was €123.525m, representing 6,170 client loans.
As at 31 December 2018 the Revenue Commissioners are currently collecting €123.448m, representing 6,169 clients.
The difference accounts for clients where their Nursing Home loan is not due for repayment such as the Further Deferral option, as mentioned above, and also clients who wish to make a voluntary repayment prior to a relevant event occurring.
The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that they had received €86.83m of loan repayments paid in full, representing 4,668 client loans.
The total amount of Nursing Home Loan payments made under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme that are outstanding (i.e. where a repayable amount has not been notified to Revenue for collection – relevant event has not occurred), as at 31 December 2018 is €115.945m.
This amount does not include an adjustment for CPI as a relevant event has not yet occurred.

The HSE carried out a significant self-review of tax compliance in respect of 2017 with external specialist tax assistance, which was completed in 2018.
The self-review was conducted on a risk based assessment across all tax heads for which the HSE needs to account.
The underpayment of tax identified in the course of the self-review was set out by means of a Self-Correction and full payment (including interest and penalties) was made to the Revenue Commissioners in September 2018.
The HSE has a dedicated in-house tax team resourced by qualified tax professionals.
The HSE remains committed to meeting its obligations in respect of its compliance with taxation laws.
Note 25 Contingent Liabilities
The HSE is involved in a number of claims involving legal proceedings which may generate liabilities, depending on the outcome of the litigation.
The HSE has insurance cover for professional indemnity, fire and specific all risk claims.
In most cases, such insurance would be sufficient to cover all costs, but this cannot be certain due to indemnity limits and certain policy conditions.
The financial effects of any uninsured contingencies have not been provided in the financial statements.
Patient Private Property Retained Interest Prior to 2005, interest income earned on patients’ private funds was retained by the former Health Boards and used to partially defray the costs incurred in administering approximately 19,000 Patients’ Private Property Accounts.
This action was based on previous legal advice.
Subsequent legal advice taken by the HSE indicated that the Patients’ Private Property Accounts operated under an implied trustee relationship with the patients and as such the HSE was obliged to remit interest earned to those patients.
The lack of available historic private patient property records limits the ability of the HSE to estimate the full potential liability and therefore a partial liability only has been provided for in the HSE's financial statements.
The HSE has set up a Steering Group to actively manage this issue to a satisfactory resolution.
Clinical Indemnity Scheme
Details of the contingent liability in respect of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme are set out in Note 11.
In June 2018, a settlement was agreed between the State and medical consultants arising from an alleged breach of contract in relation to non-implementation of the 2008 Consultants contract.
The settlement provides that 40% of the retrospective remuneration will be paid in 2019 and the balance in 2020.
The HSE’s best current estimate of the liability arising as at 31 December 2018 is circa €198 million.
An interim provision of €68m had been included in the HSE’s financial statements since 2008 and has been reversed in 2018 (see Note 6).
As explained in Note 1 Accounting Policies, no provision is reported in 2018 as the liability is being treated on a receipts and payments basis.
Note 27 Post Balance Sheet Events
No circumstances have arisen or events occurred, between the balance sheet date and the date of approval of the financial statements by the Directorate, which would require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

These procedures have been adhered to by the Health Service Directorate members and the HSE during the year.
During 2018, no Directorate members held a direct interest within any related parties.
However, one Directorate member sat on the board of the Peter McVerry Trust.
The Directorate Member sat on the board in a medical professional capacity only and is not involved in requesting or approving any payments to these entities.

HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Statement from the Director General
Statement from the Director General At the time of writing, recent events have brought the policy of Open Disclosure to the forefront, with Government now introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity.
The HSE will work with Government and patients and staff interests to fully and effectively implement that legislation.
Corporate Plan 2015-2017 2017 was the last year of our Corporate Plan 2015-2017.
This plan set out ambitious goals and targets for us to achieve in developing a first-rate service, available to people where and when they need it.
Some highlights and achievements can be seen throughout this Annual Report.
Our values of Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning are important to us.
Values in Action is working with staff to bring these values into their everyday work.
The case for change and shifting the balance
Over the last few years we have seen significant change for our health services.
In 2017 Sláintecare, the cross party Oireachtas Committee report on the Future of Healthcare, was published in May. We welcome the potential longer term stability that Sláintecare brings.
We are working with Government to develop an implementation plan for Sláintecare.
This has contributed in no small way to many of the challenges we face today including emergency department overcrowding and gaining access to many of our services.
Over 4.7 million people live in Ireland, an increase of almost 170,000 people since 2011.
Modelling forecasts tell us that people aged over 65 will increase by nearly 110,000 in the next five years. While this is great news, a large proportion of this older age group now lives with two or more chronic conditions, making many of them more vulnerable and frail.
Building a sustainable health service driven by quality and safety
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Statement from the Director General
Many health and social care systems around the world are under increasing pressure due to growing and ageing populations, increases in chronic disease, rising costs of specialist drugs and therapies, and slow funding recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.
Our health service is no different and so there is an onus on us to drive efficiencies, productivity and value from our existing funding bases – but those which are informed by national policy so that we do not lose sight of the need to deliver best health outcomes, while still improving people’s experience of using our services.
This will be a particular focus for us in 2018.
As part of reaching our aim to become a world class health service, we are on a journey of improvement and change, with strategic approaches being developed and prioritised to meet the needs of our patients and service users.
Our National Patient Safety Programme is ensuring that national safety priorities and initiatives are being implemented across our health services.
As part of the development of A Future Together – Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service, MyGP survey was undertaken which has helped us deepen our understanding of patient priorities towards improving primary care and GP services.
The development of a new, modernised GP contract is key to developing a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service.
The first ever National Patient Experience Survey was undertaken in May with patients from 40 hospitals across Ireland invited to participate.
With over 13,700 respondents, it is the largest survey on patients’ care in Ireland.
The results of this survey are very important and will influence the way we deliver our services.
The survey told us that 79% of people said that their stay in hospital was good or very good.
83% who answered said that they had confidence and trust in the hospital staff that treated them.
82% said that they were treated with respect and dignity.
However we have more to do.
36% said that they were not involved in decisions about their care as much as they would have liked to be.
49% said that they could not always find a member of staff to talk to about their worries.
The Patient Narrative Project is also putting the service user/patient voice at the centre of the design and delivery of healthcare through hearing the stories of people who use our health services and using this information to inform how we design our services.
The programme uses the opportunities that occur every day for every health professional to support patients to make a lifestyle change through a brief intervention and reduce the risk of chronic disease.
Progress continues to be made in areas such as, for example, the establishment of the National Women and Infants’ Health Programme and implementation of the National Maternity Strategy; the Healthy Ireland Framework; Connecting for Life – Ireland’s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide; the eHealth and electronic health records programme; the development of a long-awaited new architecture for ICT and logistics; implementation of the integrated care programmes.
We have taken considerable steps towards improvements in staff training and development initiatives since 2012 including the restoration of training budgets, the introduction of Staff Engagement Surveys and the Staff Forum, and the new Leadership Academy.
These initiatives provide an excellent platform to further support all of our staff.
One of our priorities over the past number of years was putting forward a case to seek an increase in capital funding for the health services in order to progress key projects.
The National Development Plan 2018-2027 (Project Ireland 2040) acknowledges the importance of these projects which include, for example 2,500 beds across the system as part of the capacity review and other hospital and community supports.
As we now move towards implementation of Sláintecare, the next number of years will be critically important for our health services.
Our values of Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning will continue to guide us in this journey, embedded by our staff every day in every healthcare setting.
This Annual Report highlights challenges ahead, services provided and examples of progress made in 2017 across a range of areas including health and wellbeing, primary care, mental health, disability services, older persons’ services, pre-hospital emergency care and acute hospital care.
Thank you
I wish to thank all members of the Directorate and Leadership Team, the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), Hospital Groups and particularly all their staff, who give so much on a day to day basis, for their dedication and commitment throughout the year.

Our Health Service
Mission
People in Ireland are supported by health and social care services to achieve their full potential
We will try to live our values every day and will continue to develop them 
People in Ireland can access safe, compassionate and quality care when they need it 
People in Ireland can be confident that we will deliver the best health outcomes and value through optimising our resources
Care
The Corporate Plan 2015-2017 sets out our aim to improve our health service over a three year period.
Our aim is to develop a first-rate service, available to people where and when they need it.
Our vision is to develop a healthier Ireland with a high quality health service valued by all.
This vision is accompanied by a mission statement that outlines how this vision can be realised.
Underpinning our plan are the values: Care, Compassion, Trust and Learning.
These values are critical to how decisions are made in delivering a health service that all can be proud of.
The plan sets out five goals, along with the actions required to achieve them.
The actions associated with these goals are reflected in each of our annual National Service Plans for the period of our Corporate Plan.
Our Annual Reports show progress that is made in implementing these goals.
Over the following pages, both achievements and challenges over the three year period are outlined.
Compassion
Trust
Learning
Promote health and wellbeing as part of everything we do so that people will be healthier
Provide fair, equitable and timely access to quality, safe health services that people need
Foster a culture that is honest, compassionate, transparent and accountable
Engage, develop and value our workforce to deliver the best possible care and services to the people who depend on them
Manage resources in a way that delivers best health outcomes, improves people’s experience of using the service and demonstrates value for money
Our Corporate Plan sets out actions and targets to be achieved over the years 2015-2017.
Some highlights and achievements from this period are set out below.
Other details can be seen throughout sections of this Annual Report.
Birth rates
The number of live births has been falling year-on-year since 2009 and in 2016 the number of registered births was 63,397.
Despite reductions in the number of births in recent years, the fertility rate in Ireland, at 1.82, remains the 2nd highest in the EU, behind France.
Life expectancy and health of the population
Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost two and a half years since 2005 and is now above the EU average, with women at just over 83 years and men at 79.3 years.
The greatest gains in life expectancy have been achieved in the older age groups, reflecting significant reductions in major causes of death.
Age standardised mortality rates from diseases of the circulatory system, which remain the major cause of death (30% of all deaths), have declined over the last decade as has mortality across most principal causes of death.
Diseases of the circulatory system fell by 28.4% between 2007 and 2016 and cancer mortality rates decreased by 9.9% over the same period.
There have been improvements seen in survival rates from breast, cervical, colon and rectal cancer in the last 15 years.
However, with the exception of rectal cancer, 5-year net survival rates are lower in Ireland than the average for OECD countries, where data is available.
Chronic disease
Approximately three quarters of deaths in Ireland are due to three chronic diseases – cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases.
From 2017 to 2022, it is estimated there will be more than a 17% increase in the number of adults aged 65 years and over with two or more chronic conditions.
Approximately 86% of people aged 65 years and over have one or more chronic diseases, and 65% of people aged 65 years and over live with multi-morbidity (two or more chronic conditions) (The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), wave1, 2010).
These statistics and trends provide us with an understanding of the demographic change and the challenges we face which have implications for future planning and health service delivery.
Through monitoring the performance of the health system we will continue to plan so that resources available to health and social care are targeted towards providing care and support for those patients and clients most in need, and ensuring that these services are delivered efficiently and effectively, consistent with best available evidence.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Listening to our Service Users
Listening to our Service Users We are actively ensuring that we listen to the views and opinions of patients and service users and consider them in how services are planned, delivered and improved.
A number of areas were progressed during the year to promote patient and service user involvement across our health services.
What you told us
Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service
The MyGP survey was undertaken to help us deepen our understanding of patient priorities and improve primary care and GP services.
Over 6,000 people responded, with very positive results including: •
91% of patients indicated they were satisfied with their GP service.
61% reported satisfaction with access to their GP service.
77% were satisfied with the health information provided.
81% found staff to be suitably discreet.
This feedback, combined with the learning from other stakeholder engagements, formed the basis for the report A Future Together – Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service which will inform the development of a more person-centred primary care service.
National Patient Experience Survey The first ever National Patient Experience Survey was undertaken in May with 26,635 patients from 40 hospitals across Ireland invited to participate.
With a response rate of 51% (13,706 respondents), it is the largest survey on patients’ care in Ireland.
The results were launched in December.
Overall:
• 79% of respondents described the admission to hospital phase as good or very good. •
However, 16% of respondents rated their experience as fair to poor.
49% said they could not always find a member of staff to talk to about their worries or fears.
36% said that they were not involved in decisions about their care as much as they would have liked to be.
The survey underlines the fact that access remains the biggest challenge facing our health service.
Measuring and analysing patients’ experience is essential to realising what is working well and what needs to change.
In the HSE’s response to the survey, Listening, Responding and Improving, a commitment was given to the implementation of a programme of work designed to improve patient experience across acute hospital services with an action plan and a reporting structure in place to provide assurance that we are making a real difference for patients across Ireland.
Areas of focus include: •
Improving wait times and communication with patients in EDs.
Ensuring that patients have the opportunity to talk to members of staff about their concerns.
Promoting clinical communication among healthcare professionals.
Improving written information on what to do after leaving hospital.
Promoting and sustaining a culture of dignity and respect for patients.
Maternity care complaints
A review of maternity care complaints was published which examined patient complaints made concerning care experienced between 1975 and 2015.
The review process has provided important learning for maternity services in Ireland.
The information it has generated, insights into patient experiences, and findings it has made, is assisting us in improving how we provide maternity care in Ireland.
Office of the Confidential Recipient The Office of the Confidential Recipient is a national service, receiving concerns/complaints in an independent capacity, and has dealt with over 500 formal concerns/ complaints from across the country since its establishment in December 2014.
In 2017, the total number of formal concerns/complaints received by the Confidential Recipient was 196, a slight reduction on 2016.
The type of concerns raised include safeguarding, client placement/planning, access to equipment, level of staff to support client, financial charges, staff behaviour, and safety of care.
Listening to our Service Users Further information and contact details for the Confidential Recipient can be found at www.hse.ie.
Partnering with Patients, Service Users and Families Working together
Partnering with patients, service users and families in the planning, design and delivery of services brings unique patient insights and perspectives to deliberations and decisions, ensures that resources are utilised to meet the needs of patients and helps to build trust and confidence in the health service.
Patient Narrative Project
The Patient Narrative Project positions the patient/service user voice centrally in the design and delivery of healthcare through hearing the stories of people using our health services.
In essence, the project wants to progress and instil the philosophy of ‘patients as partners’ in health.
Phase 1 of the Patient Narrative Project was launched and has delivered a service user-developed definition of integrated care.
In summary, people want to be at the centre of all discussions and decisions about their healthcare, and for this healthcare to be built around them and their world.
This is called ‘person-centred co-ordinated care’.
Phase 2 of the Patient Narrative Project is Your Voice Matters.
It is a survey that will provide a high volume of patient experience feedback on a continual basis in the form of statistical data, backed up with explanatory narrative in the words of patients and service users themselves.
It allows patients to tell us how we are doing in the journey towards person-centred co-ordinated care – a framework that asks ‘Are we there yet?’ The benefit of Your Voice Matters is that it allows for a more detailed insight into patient and service user experience, helping us to understand how well we are delivering on what we have already been told our patients and service users want.
An analysis of the results of the pilot survey, which ran until October, is underway with results available in early 2018.
Proactive work continues to promote and facilitate such partnership, including: •
The National Patient Forum is made up of representatives from national advocacy groups, patients and carers.
During the year the forum engaged with the HSE on a number of projects, including the eHealth programme, the Leadership Academy, integrated care, and transforming urgent and emergency care.
Patients for Patient Safety Ireland comprises people who experienced serious harm or death of a loved one in the Irish healthcare system, as well as healthcare staff.
The group is part of the global World Health Organisation (WHO) network and works collaboratively with the HSE to improve patient safety.
A National Patient Representative Panel was established.
Members of the panel are patients, service users, carers and family members and representatives participate in focus groups, steering and working groups and provide an input into a wide range of programmes and projects.
During the year, the HSE worked in partnership with the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care to capture the individual stories of patients, family members and carers who have used palliative care services.
Within mental health services •
The National Framework for Recovery in Mental Health 2018-2020 was launched.
This framework was co-produced with service users, family members, carers and experts by experience.
Through implementation of Partnership for Change – Report of the Mental Health Reference Group, Area Leads for mental health engagement were appointed to each CHO and 20 peer support workers were appointed.
Further information on these initiatives can be seen on page 50 of this Annual Report.

Workshops and conferences
A number of workshops and conferences were held during the year with a specific focus on the service user experience.
These included: •
Patient narrative workshops to deliver the patient/ service user perspective on what should be expected from person-centred, co-ordinated care in the Irish health service.
A national mental health nursing conference on embedding recovery principles in psychiatric/ mental health nursing practice.
This collaborative event provided opportunities for families, service users and advocates to present personal stories and experiences to reduce stigma and promote mental health and wellbeing.
A number of integrated care programme and national clinical care programme workshops, including workshops on older persons’ services and diabetes care.
There were 8,281 complaints recorded and examined by complaints officers under the Health Act 2004, a decrease of 877 (9.5%) on the number recorded in 2016.
Of the total number of complaints received, 6,298 or 76% were dealt with within 30 working days.

Listening to our Service Users
Other patient and service user feedback Informing how we will improve our services The comments below reflect some of the communication received from patients and service users in relation to their own experience of our health services.
All feedback, both positive and negative, is used to actively progress improvements as part of building a safe, efficient, person-centred service.

Building a Better Health Service
Building a Better Health Service
As part of reaching our aim to become a world class health service available to people where and when they need it, the health service is on a journey of improvement and change, with strategic approaches being developed and prioritised to meet the needs of our patients and service users.
Improving the quality and safety of our services
A key focus in improving quality and safety is listening to the views and opinions of patients and service users and considering them in how services are planned and delivered.
Details of this can be seen in the Listening to our Service Users section of this Annual Report.
A three-year National Patient Safety Programme has been established which, alongside the Framework for Improving Quality in our Health Service, is driving the implementation of national safety priorities and initiatives across all parts of the health system.
Targeting safety initiatives through clinical leadership •
The number of sepsis associated hospital deaths has fallen by 30% over the past five years.
The decrease is due to better recognition and treatment in hospitals nationally.
New educational and support tools have also been launched to further support clinicians in sepsis management.
Phase 3 of the national Pressure Ulcers to Zero (PUTZ) campaign is being rolled out, with a 49% reduction in ward acquired pressure ulcers across the 23 participating teams.
Hand hygiene is the single most effective measure that healthcare workers, patients and the public can undertake to prevent HCAIs.
Hand hygiene compliance rates are at their highest ever levels (90.8%).
Work is on-going with healthcare facilities to further improve compliance rates by implementing action plans including education, training and re-audit programmes.
To promote safe, rational and cost effective medicines management three masterclasses were held, attended by nurses, midwives, doctors and pharmacists from all settings.
Multi-disciplinary teams from 27 hospitals participated in a quality improvement collaborative.
This resulted in 35,000 more patients getting the most appropriate blood clot prevention for them, building knowledge and skills in blood clot prevention and quality improvement.
To support safe decontamination practice, the National Decontamination Safety Programme published guidance on the transport of reusable medical devices, decontamination of ultrasound equipment and design and equipping of endoscope decontamination units.
The Central Decontamination Unit team in Our Lady’s Hospital (Navan), in collaboration with the national programme, became the first hospital to achieve external accreditation to ISO 13485 with the National Standards Authority of Ireland.

Building a Better Health Service
New national standards for quality and safety in occupational health services were launched to promote consistency of service delivery throughout the country.
The standards are grouped according to five themes – worker-centred care, safe and effective care, leadership and governance, workforce planning and the use of information – and can be seen at www.hse.ie/workwell.
Healthcare audits provide assurance that services delivered meet statutory obligations in accordance with best practice.
Four summary national healthcare audit reports were published, relating to key safety issues such as the communication of patient critical information and the detection of and response to rapid deterioration in patients.
MEASUREMENT FOR QUALITY
Schwarz Rounds offer healthcare staff time and space to reflect on the impact of their work, gaining knowledge that will help in caring for patients.
A new collaboration was announced between the HSE and the Point of Care Foundation to establish rounds in 30 sites through formal service level agreement.
Keeping ourselves up-to-date on good practice and sharing learning are key to improving quality.
A series of one hour webinars continued during the year, structured to build a firm grounding in the essentials of quality improvement. •
New guidance was published to assist new and existing healthcare boards in using practices to drive safety, quality and a culture of personcentredness.
A Board’s Role in Improving Quality and Safety presents a practical guide by providing examples of leading practices, resources and recommended reading.

Improving access and improving the patient experience during the winter period
The aim of the Winter Initiative 2016-2017 was to identify and focus on specific measures designed to address the anticipated surge in health service activity in both hospitals and the community during the winter months.
The plan contained a number of key measures both in terms of hospital avoidance and in safe and timely discharge, and was implemented following a robust planning process undertaken with all key stakeholders.
While not all targets were met, a number of positive outcomes were achieved:
• The winter initiative provided for the expansion of CITs in Dublin North, Louth/Meath, Galway/Roscommon and South Tipperary.
•  997 additional home care packages were provided.
•  658 additional transitional care beds were available.
•  Funding to discharge 18 complex discharges was provided and a total of 27 discharges were enabled.
•  Delayed discharges were reduced to below 500.
•  113 additional acute beds were opened.
•  4,458 patients were supplied with aids and appliances to facilitate their safe and timely discharge.
As part of the Winter Initiative 2017-2018, measures identified included:
• Funding to support a number of complex discharges.
• An increase in home and transitional care funding to assist with efficient discharging from acute hospitals.
• Funding to support the Under the Weather influenza campaign.
Despite increases of almost 3% in ED attendances, and increases of almost 6% in ED attendances and admissions for persons aged 75 years and over, by year end reported 8am trolleys were reduced by 2.6% on the previous year.
Building a Better Health Service
Developing nursing and midwifery services •
Education and support has been provided to increase to 990 the number of nurses and midwives registered as nurse prescribers, with 320 nurses and midwives now authorised to prescribe ionising radiation (x-ray).
Quality care metrics, designed to measure the care provided by nurses and midwives using real time data, were finalised for the areas of public health and community nursing, mental health, intellectual disability, older persons, children, acute services and midwifery.
125 candidate advanced nurse practitioners are undertaking education programmes with targeted areas of practice being unscheduled care, rheumatology, respiratory and older persons.
Implementation of the Caring Behaviours Assurance System for Ireland (CBAS-I) continued, with the programme delivered in Portiuncula University Hospital and commenced in University Maternity Hospital Limerick.
The Framework for Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing is being piloted in three sites (Beaumont Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and St. Columcille’s Hospital), measuring patient outcomes, nurse staffing, nurse workload and the working environment.
New national education programmes for nurses were developed and implemented in critical care nursing, anaesthetic recovery room nursing and unscheduled care nursing.
Implementation of a National Frailty Education Programme for nurses and health professionals was supported with 107 frailty facilitators completing the Facilitator’s Development Programme and 430 healthcare professionals completing a Fundamentals of Frailty Education Programme.
Health service improvement
The Programme for Health Service Improvement (PHSI) is supporting the building of a better health service for the population of Ireland.
It is implementing a strategic and programmatic approach to delivering tangible, sustainable change and improvement across the health service as we evolve to adapt for the future.
A number of major programmes are in place covering service design/ improvement, service delivery and enabling services which have a robust governance and support structure in place.
The programmes include:
Implementation of the CHOs, Hospital Groups, NAS and enabling services
Transformation of the national centre
Quality assurance and quality improvement
National clinical and integrated care programmes
Primary care and PCRS improvement
eHealth Ireland, including the electronic health record (EHR)
Finance reform
HR and communications improvement.
Programme management offices have been established in CHOs and Hospital Groups as well as in the national centre, NAS, and in a number of enabling functions to support and enable the sustainable implementation of these strategic and service priorities.
A project management methodology and a training course have been developed, and a robust online management tracking and management tool is in place to actively support these programmes and provide reporting capability as required.
Developing a performing and accountable health service
To build a better health service, we must review and assess how we are achieving against the objectives we set ourselves.
Our focus is on improving the performance of our services and our accountability for those services.
Our primary responsibility is to the Minister for Health but the HSE also has a range of other accountability obligations to the Oireachtas and to its Regulators.
Our Performance and Accountability Framework 2017 makes explicit the responsibilities of managers in relation to the four equally important domains of the National Scorecard which are Access to services, the Quality and Safety of those services, doing this within the Financial Resources available and by effectively harnessing the efforts of the Workforce.
Implementation of the Performance and Accountability Framework focuses attention on the delivery of services relative to the anticipated level of performance and drives necessary improvements in performance which are warranted.
The Framework also provides for the public reporting of services.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Safeguarding and Protection
Safeguarding vulnerable people
In 2014, the HSE published its safeguarding policy for older people and people with a disability who, as a result of physical or intellectual impairment, may be at risk of abuse.
Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse – National Policy and Procedures sets out a number of principles to promote the welfare of vulnerable people and safeguard them from abuse.
Safeguarding and Protection Teams, established in each of the nine CHOs since 2015, manage community referrals and safeguarding concerns within service settings.
All safeguarding concerns are treated in confidence and, as much as possible, are handled in a way that respects the wishes of the person at risk.
The service is focused on the client, aimed at the safety and wellbeing of the person at risk, while providing support to stop the abusive behaviour.
A review commenced of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse – National Policy and Procedures.
The review involved widespread consultation with key stakeholders through formal submissions and focus groups.
The outcome of the review is due to be finalised at the end of Quarter 2, 2018.
Safeguarding data from each of the nine CHOs was published.
This information, for 2016, represents the first year of data collection and shows that there was a total of 7,884 safeguarding concerns managed (4,749 relating to adults aged 18-64 years, 3,029 relating to adults over 65 years and, of these, 1,221 relating to adults over 80 years).
Findings from a Red C nationwide public opinion survey in 2016 on attitudes and awareness of abuse of vulnerable persons were published.
The survey sought to understand perceptions around and treatment of vulnerable adults in Ireland.
The findings from the survey can be viewed on www.safeguardingcommittee.ie which resulted in the roll-out of a public awareness campaign.
21,000 staff in HSE and HSE funded agencies were trained in safeguarding.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
The National Safeguarding Committee was established to support the safeguarding agenda and is a multi-agency and inter-sectoral body working collaboratively with one common goal – to ensure that adults who may be vulnerable are safeguarded.
In 2016, the National Safeguarding Committee Strategic Plan 2017-2021 was published, which will guide the work of the committee for the next five years.
Reports from the National Safeguarding Committee are available on www.safeguardingcommittee.ie.
The National Safeguarding Office oversees the implementation, monitoring, review and on-going evaluation of the safeguarding policy.
The Office compiles data, undertakes analysis and publishes an annual data report.
Further details on the HSE safeguarding service including reports are on www.hse.ie/safeguarding.
Public awareness campaign…
The aim of the campaign was to encourage greater vigilance among the state, financial and nursing home sectors as well as among family members and carers to recognise and tackle abuse of vulnerable adults.
Its focus was on the subtle nature of abuse such as locking an older person in a room while out, over medicating a person to calm them or quietly taking money from an older person to cover care costs, all acts of abuse of people’s liberties and rights.
Safeguarding and Protection
Assisted DecisionMaking
The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was enacted to put in place a modern legislative framework to support decisionmaking and to maximise a person’s capacity to make decisions.
While the Act has not fully commenced, the HSE is doing a number of things to prepare staff and services for its full commencement: •
A national steering group has been established made up of staff, service users and expert advisors to prepare guidance for what the Act will mean in day to day practice.
A national consultation process took place.
A training and education programme is being prepared and a website developed.
The Act is a reforming piece of legislation which abolishes the previous Wards of Court system.
Essentially this means that those with difficulty making decisions about their finances, healthcare, living arrangements etc. will be helped, where possible, to make these decisions for themselves or where this is not possible, a representative will be appointed by the Circuit Court.
Assisted Decision-Making in Action John sustained a traumatic brain injury and now lives in a residential service.
It was decided to make him a Ward of Court.
As a Ward of Court, John was unable to make financial or medical decisions and could not travel without the approval of the court.
However once the Assisted Decision-Making Act commences, John will be discharged from Wardship.
While he still may require support for certain decisions of a financial or medical nature, the new law will maximise his autonomy to make decisions and ensure his wishes are fully respected.
Children First To ensure the safeguarding of children: •
Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017 was launched and is available on www.childrenfirst.ie
A mandatory eLearning training programme was developed on www.hseland.ie.
83,000 staff, including those of funded and contracted agencies, have completed training.
The Children First compliance checklist for funded and contracted agencies has been rolled out to all CHOs and Hospital Groups.
The development of local Child Safeguarding Statements was progressed across CHOs and Hospital Groups.
National Independent
Review Panel
The National Independent Review Panel was set up in 2017 to provide the HSE with a means to independently review cases where there appears to have been serious failings across the HSE and HSE funded services, for people with a disability.
Its remit is to review the circumstances surrounding such cases, and present reports on its findings and recommendations.
Following appointment of an independent Chair in late 2016, five panel members, responsible for investigating a range of serious incidents, were appointed during 2017.

Innovative support co-ordination for older persons
This joint project between the HSE and ALONE, aims to keep older people living well at home for as long as possible.
By co-ordinating and organising services for older people who might need some extra support to continue living at home or some practical help to return home from hospital, the two agencies to-date supported 489 older people in Dublin North City and County.
Trained volunteers provide: • A befriending and event service • Benefit and entitlements activation • Access to primary care services • Applications and oversight of adaption grants • End of life planning • Budgeting.
The aim of the project is to: • Reduce hospital admission and support older people being discharged to return home.
• Avoid nursing home admissions, for older people with lower support needs.
• Identify factors preventing an older person from living well at home and identify the practical, social resources and supports to address these factors.
• Link in with community and primary care supports.
• Co-ordinate multiple supports across state agencies and local community and private services.
• Apply for grants and aids for housing adaptions, and help with practical home modifications.
• Combat loneliness and isolation through befriending and advocacy services.
The programme creates a cost effective, scalable and transferable model by working with all services in the area to ensure older people get the support they need.
The roll-out of assistive technology to produce needs-based outputs available in real time is also being trialled.
A management information system has been developed to enhance the measuring and reporting of data.
Popular Choice Award
Serum eye drop programme – the Galway Blood and Tissue Establishment at University Hospital Galway
Prior to 2011, all patients prescribed autologous serum eye drops (ASEs) in Ireland had their serum derived from a unit of autologous (donated from the patient themselves) blood shipped to Speke, Liverpool for processing.
The product was then shipped back to Ireland and issued to the patient by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.
The team carried out extensive research into the manufacture of the product in various sites worldwide and have dedicated years of service to obtaining the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMF) licence to produce autologous and allogenic (patient not suitable for donation so blood is obtained from the National Blood Centre) serum eye drops.
University Hospital Galway is now the only hospital in Ireland licenced to produce serum eye drops (SEs).
As there is no other site in Ireland manufacturing this product, all aspects of the procedure from patient assessment to production have been devised entirely by Galway Blood and Tissue Establishment.
SEs are a serum-derived product used to treat a range of ocular surface disorders.
2017 has been the busiest year for SEs to date and this has to be attributed to the ASE team for delivering such an efficient programme.
There are many patients throughout the country whose lives have been drastically improved thanks to this treatment.
HR Special Award
Bronntanas – Support to parents experiencing difficulties at Christmas The Bronntanas Project which is managed by Tusla staff in Co.
Mayo, in collaboration with staff in the HSE and Mayo County Council supports parents in Mayo who are experiencing difficulties at Christmas by providing a gift for them to give to their children on Christmas morning.
Volunteers from around the county, recruited through a media campaign, along with volunteers from the HSE, TUSLA and Mayo County Council purchase a small Christmas gift for a specific child whose parents are unable to do so.
The families are identified by community services or by their contact with the scheme co-ordinator.
Their requests are coded and volunteers are given brief details of what gift to purchase and a central point to drop it off.
Vouchers can also be given to parents to help towards the cost of a more expensive item.
The scheme co-ordinator manages the distribution of the gifts.
The parents who use the scheme find the professional way in which the gifts are organised to be supportive and nonjudgemental.
The scheme, which came to fruition after a conversation between staff on a coffee break 15 years ago, has grown from strength to strength.
Every year there is more demand for gifts.
In 2015 they provided over 250 gifts for children in Mayo, in 2016 it rose to 350 and over 500 presents were given out in 2017, bringing a little Christmas magic to many homes in need.

European Restart a Heart Week took place in October to create awareness that everyone can and should become familiar with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
If someone suffers a cardiac arrest, their chances of survival double if it happens in front of a bystander who immediately rings 112/999 and starts CPR before an ambulance’s arrival.
Throughout the week, hundreds of HSE staff around the country took part in CPR familiarisation sessions where they could listen to a simulated 112/999 call, follow the instructions of a paramedic and practise CPR, with the assistance of volunteers from the National Ambulance Service, resuscitation training officers and community first responders.
Improving operational performance and outcomes for patients •
To further improve response times and expand the intermediate care service (ICS), which supports Hospital Groups in inter-hospital transfers, additional staff were trained, including: -
87 paramedics completed their post-graduate training and were deployed to operational bases, while 95 student paramedics commenced their training programme.
52 new intermediate care operatives completed their training programme and were deployed.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Response times are steadily improving with 83% of ECHO calls (life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest) and 61% of DELTA calls (other life-threatening illness or injury) responded to within 18 minutes and 59 seconds.
Work continued, as part of the National Transport Medicine Programme to develop patient retrieval services in support of clinical networks and in line with national policy.
Recruitment campaigns are underway to progress the implementation of the Road Safety Authority Emergency Services Driving Standards and the development of an emergency management function.
Pre-Hospital Emergency Care

Seven year old Sophie Doyle received a certificate of bravery after ringing 999 to tell them that her mother, Janet, had gone into anaphylactic shock.
Speaking after the incident, Janet Doyle said she was amazed at the service, and how the ambulance and dispatch team worked together to get her safely to hospital, while also keeping Sophie calm.
Improving quality of care and patient safety through enhancing clinical competencies and governance arrangements
Providing a flexible, safe, responsive and effective service to meet planned alternative models of patient care and improving the health needs of the population •
The number of community first responder schemes has increased to 168 (from 145 in 2016) and three Community Engagement Officers have been appointed to focus on targeted areas.
Progression of the alternative care pathway, Hear and Treat, is on-going, through the appointment and training of an initial cohort of staff and development of the necessary infrastructure including a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system.
Community-based education and training programmes were progressed within the development of community first responder schemes and the work of the Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Steering Group.
The National Ambulance Service Review of Organisational Design was finalised as part of the process to commence implementation of the NAS Operating Model.
Roll-out of the electronic patient care record (ePCR) commenced, allowing a more complete picture of each individual patient’s acute episode to be provided to the receiving ED, and plans for the next phase of roll-out are on target.
New key performance indicators and a framework for their implementation were developed, with planned pilot testing to commence in 2018.
Deploying the most appropriate resources safely, quickly and efficiently •
To ensure that the NAS fleet and equipment are cost effective, maintained to a high standard and capable of meeting future models of service delivery, a fleet and equipment plan has been implemented with monthly status reports provided.
The NAS was announced as the winner in the Public Service category of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland’s (SEAI) Energy Awards 2017.
This award was delivered in recognition of the NAS commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, and the sustainable energy options that are now available in the NAS fleet including 50 of the new vehicles being equipped with solar panels.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Acute Hospital Care
Acute hospitals provide a wide range of services including inpatient, day case, outpatient, emergency, diagnostic, maternity and cancer services.
In 2017, the demand for services continued to increase in line with a growing and ageing population and the focus remained on providing quality safe services to service users.
The National Patient
Experience Survey, the first of its kind in Ireland and a joint initiative between HIQA, the HSE and DoH, took place in
26,635 patients from 40 acute hospitals were invited to participate, and the survey had a response rate of 51%.
While 79% of respondents rated their hospital experience as good or very good, 16% rated their experience as fair to poor, with patients admitted to hospital in an emergency giving lower ratings of overall experience of care than those patients whose stay in hospital was planned in advance.
Pictured at the launch of the survey were:
Phelim, CEO, HIQA
Minister for Health HSE.
Key concerns for patients related to their experience of ED, care on the ward, communication and information and the discharge process.
Findings from the survey will be used to shape future healthcare policy and improve outcomes for patients.
See www.patientexperience.ie for more information.
Further information in relation to the survey can be seen on page 16 of this Annual Report.
Key priorities in 2017 were delivering care safely and efficiently, improving access to urgent and planned care and improving the patient experience. •
Delivering quality care through our Hospital Groups •
To build quality and patient safety capacity across hospitals, an analysis of resources is on-going and the roll-out of phase 2 of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) continues in acute hospitals.
Acute Hospital Care Monitoring and controlling healthcare associated infections •
Some of our Activity in 2017 • 1,708,059 patients were discharged from hospital – 635,663 inpatient and 1,072,396 day case – an increase of 21,900 compared to 2016.
• 1,416,449 emergency presentations to acute hospitals (increase of 4%).
Increasing critical care capacity •
• 3,307,079 outpatient attendances (decrease of 0.4%).
• 1,279,712 ED attendances (increase of 3%).
• 87% of adults were waiting less than 15 months for an inpatient procedure and 93% for a day care procedure (89% and 86% respectively for children) by the end of the year.
Improving inpatient flow •
Under the Patient Flow programme, several projects commenced in Galway University Hospitals and University of Limerick Hospital, including: -
Effecting improvements in emergency surgical flow
Improving bed turnaround times and reducing delay in ED transfers
Improving discharge planning and increasing early morning discharges.
• 72% of patients were waiting less than 52 weeks for an OPD appointment by the end of the year.
• 68 patients were waiting more than four weeks for an urgent colonoscopy by year end and 58% of patients were waiting less than 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy.
Meeting the demand for unscheduled care remained challenging with a sustained increase in ED attendances.
Approximately 30,000 more people attended our EDs compared with the previous year, including an additional 8,800 patients over the age of 75.
Work continued on the ED taskforce plan recommendations in relation to patient experience time, to address the on-going pressures experienced in EDs and in particular to reduce waiting times for patients over 75 years.
Despite the increased demand, the number of patients waiting more than 24 hours in EDs reduced by approximately 1,400 patients of whom 800 were aged over 75 years.
113 additional beds had been provided in our hospitals by the end of the 2016/2017 winter initiative, with a further 74 acute beds in place by year end as part of the 2017/2018 initiative.
Further information can be seen on page 24 of this Annual Report.
Work continued on developing integrated care teams for older people in conjunction with the CHOs.
Further information in relation to this can be seen on page 24 of this Annual Report.
Improving access to urgent and planned care •
To improve hospital capacity, a number of new and replacement units opened during the year, including a 75-bed replacement ward block in University Hospital Galway and a new ED in University Hospital Limerick.
Phase 2 of the acute medical assessment unit (AMAU) in Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise also progressed during 2017.
Work continued with the NTPF to implement waiting list initiatives, reduce waiting times and provide treatment to those patients waiting longest.
38,991 patients were identified where a 15 month waiting period would be exceeded if no action was taken and, of these, 31,600 were removed from the waiting list.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Acute Hospital Care
The scoliosis waiting list update and service development plan was developed which aimed to ensure that no scoliosis patient who required surgery would be waiting more than four months for surgery, where clinically appropriate, by the end of the year.
This initiative resulted in an increase in capacity at Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital (Crumlin), Children’s University Hospital (Temple Street), Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, and the option of surgical treatment in specialist centres in the UK, Germany and France.
Development continues of a sustained, contemporary, valuesbased and patient-centred approach to service delivery in scoliosis and orthopaedic services.
Following a national GI endoscopy demand and capacity review process, a number of initiatives were progressed including development of an action plan to improve access, establishment of a working group to improve co-ordination and communication across services, and appointment of endoscopy clinical leads to lead on service improvement at group level.
• The Outpatient Services Performance Improvement Programme (OSPIP) continues to be implemented.
Work has commenced on referral pathways for seven specialties and the design of the urology prototype pathway has been completed.
Recruitment is being progressed, in line with the recommendations of the Independent Clinical Review of provision of a Second Catheterisation Laboratory at University Hospital Waterford (Herity Report), to provide additional weekly planned cardiac catheterisation laboratory sessions.
A mobile cardiac catheterisation laboratory is in place in the interim.
Both the National Rare Diseases Office and the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases are working with healthcare providers to encourage them to sign up to be listed on Orphanet (a panEuropean database of expertise in the area of rare disease).
By the end of the year a total of 51 centres of expertise in Ireland were validated and listed on Orphanet.
Guidelines have been developed for the prescribing of two multiple sclerosis drugs, Infliximab and Lemtrada. •

The National Integrated Staff Records and Pay Programme (NiSRP).
It will provide the foundation for a strong ‘Hire to Retire’ support structure for staff, ensuring that comprehensive workforce information is available to manage resources in a way that delivers best health outcomes, improves people’s experience of using the service and demonstrates value for money.
A Pensions Programme focused on improvements for a compliant customer-centred pension service for the HSE, its employees and its pensioners.
It will implement robust processes in the area of contract and commercial compliance and is being implemented in CHOs, Hospital Groups and TUSLA.

Communications •
A Digital Roadmap, to transform the online user experience, continues to be developed. •
HSE social media was a leading source of information for the public during October’s Storm Ophelia with posts seen by over half a million people.
Campaigns like Ask About Alcohol, Dementia: Understand Together, #littlethings, QUIT, THINK contraception and Under the Weather, raised awareness and supported people to improve their, and their families, health and wellbeing.
A revised severe weather planning guidance and checklist document was delivered by Emergency Management, and utilised during Storm Ophelia, to assist the managers of all HSE services in preparing for, responding to and recovering from the effects of a severe weather event.
External emergency plans for top tier Seveso (Hazardous Material) sites were reviewed, updated and tested in compliance with legislation.
Planning and Business Information •
The Planning Unit co-ordinated the development and publication of the National Service Plan 2018 (together with the annual Estimates which informed preparation of the Budget for 2018) and the Annual Report 2016.
Work commenced on the development of the next Corporate Plan.
This will build on the work undertaken on the Corporate Plan 2015-2017.
The work of the National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) was supported through the development of performance profiles as part of the performance assurance process.
Performance profiles and management data reports were developed and published online on a bi-monthly basis.
Work is underway on the development of a number of projects including a HealthStat automation project, CIF set-up, and completion of a corporate performance dashboard.
Internal Audit •
A comprehensive programme of audits, including audits of HSE funded agencies, was conducted.
Special investigations were undertaken as required.

HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Governance Financial Governance
Operating and Financial Overview 2017 Introduction 2017 was the last year of the HSE’s Corporate Plan 2015-2017.
However, in the context of the Ireland of today it has been acknowledged that the current model for healthcare in Ireland requires additional reform and longer term planning. The Committee on the Future of Healthcare which was set up to achieve a cross party consensus on the future of healthcare and health policy in Ireland published the Slaintecare Report in May 2017 which is welcomed by the HSE.
Strategic Context
Annually the HSE is required to maximise the level and quality of service delivery within the limit of the resources available and also to ensure that on-going sustainable improvements are realised across the system.
In that context it is important to recognise the service demands and pressures arising from a population that is: •
Growing in numbers.
Based on Census 2016 the current population of Ireland is 4.7 million people, representing a 12% increase in population since 2005 when the HSE was established.
The ERSI1* has projected that the population will increase by up to 23% between now and 2030.
Living longer.
Life expectancy in Ireland has risen 2.4 years since 2005, and almost 13% of the overall population is now 65 or older.
It is expected that the number of people aged 65 will increase by up to 21% by 2020 with the number of adults aged over 85 rising by 4%.
Although many people are living longer in better health, there are also an increasing number of older people presenting with challenges such as chronic disease, disabilities and cognitive loss.
ESRI Report, Projections of demand for healthcare in Ireland 2015-2030.
Health Service Improvement
The ambition and aim of the HSE is to deliver the best health service possible within the resources available and it is essential that our services are organised in a way that ensures they are capable of responding to the healthcare needs of our communities.
In order to achieve this a comprehensive improvement programme has been initiated which focuses on advancing the quality and safety of our services, providing care in a more integrated way and implementing public health and health promotion initiatives in line with the recommendations of the Slaintecare Report.
The Slaintecare Report acknowledges that to achieve the best outcomes for our population that safe, quality services must be provided where and when they are needed.
The establishment of Hospital Groups (HGs) and Community Health Care Organisations (CHOs) is a key element in the delivery of this strategy.
The Slaintecare Report supports the ongoing development of these HGs and CHOS and in particular seeks to ensure greater alignment between these HGs and CHOs to deliver fully integrated care and to ensure that services are provided where they are needed to achieve good and safe outcomes for the citizens of Ireland.
Financial Governance
Hospital Groups
Financial Overview
There are now seven hospital groups which are responsible for the delivery of hospital services.
These hospital groups allow a more co-ordinated approach to both the planning and delivery of acute care.
The Acute Hospital sector including National Ambulance Service accounts for almost 39% of overall HSE expenditure in recognition of the challenges faced with providing Hospital Services in the context of a rising and aging population, with a significant increase in the presentation of chronic illness as well as the impact of lifestyle choices on the health of the Irish population.
The ESRI have predicted that the demand for Hospital services is expected to rise by 37% for inpatient bed days and 30% for inpatient cases by 2030.
The HSE benefitted from an increased determination for health of €14.2 billion in 2017.
This represented an increase of €0.6 billion or 5% over the 2016 allocation.
Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs)
There are now nine regional Community Healthcare Organisations which are responsible for the delivery of community health services.
These CHOs will deliver HSE and funded agency services at local level thereby increasing access of services to people in the community.
Social Care and Primary Care (including Primary Care Reimbursement Service PCRS) represent 45% of overall HSE expenditure.
It is predicted that demand for services such as home help care as well as residential and intermediate care in nursing homes could increase by up to 60% in the years to 2030 due to the rise in population and the increase in an aging population.
(ESRI projections)
The operational financial outturn for 2017 as reported in the financial statements shows a Revenue Income and Expenditure deficit of €129.6m, which includes the receipt of €208.3m of once-off revenue funding which was provided by way of a supplementary estimate for 2017.
The letter of determination received on the 29th December indicated that of the funding received €75m was available for central pay awards, €50m for State Claims Agency, €47.7m in relation to a shortfall on acute income and €35.6m was also made available for the winter access programme.
Including the impact of the “first charge”, the overall result for 2017 is a deficit for health of €139.9m, which is noted below and illustrated in table 4.
Under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act, 2014 the financial control mechanism known as “first charge” was introduced for the HSE and the first period to which this related was the 2016 financial year.
Acute Hospitals Services Acute services include emergency care, urgent care, short term stabilisation, scheduled care, trauma, acute surgery, critical care and pre-hospital care for adults and children.
Hospitals continually work to improve access to scheduled and unscheduled care, ensuring quality and patient safety within the allocated budget.
The seven Hospital Groups provide the structure to deliver an integrated hospital network of acute care in each geographic area.
There is an overriding requirement for the HSE to maximise the provision of essential and safe services within the totality of the funding available.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
The final outturn for Acute Hospital Services in 2017 was €5,919m, which included deficit of €139.7m.
The constituent elements of this deficit are as follows; €23m related to bad debt provision, €69m related to the cost of operational services, this was substantially in clinical non-pay which had a €44m adverse position.
In addition, there was a €20m shortfall on hospital private maintenance charges.
This was after the application of once off funding of €42m to this category by way of Supplementary Estimate.
Activity delivery in many areas was higher than the targets set out in NSP 2017, in terms of both activity volume and overall complexity.
The adverse variance experienced in clinical costs of €44m is a direct reflection of this enhanced level of service delivery.
Financial Governance Disability and Older Persons Services
Mental Health Services The challenge in 2017 for the Disability and Older Persons Services was to meet the rising demand for services as a result of an aging population, longer life expectancy, coupled with changing needs and an increasing number of people with a disability with more complex service requirements. The final outturn for the Social Care Services in 2017 was €3,072m, which included a deficit of €24.5m.
The final outturn for Mental Health Services in 2017 was €842m, which included a surplus of €0.3m.
This surplus was delivered as cost pressures in the areas of staffing and the increasing costs of private placements were balanced substantially by savings arising from the difficulty and timing around hiring new and replacement posts.
In relation to service delivery there were a number of developments progressed in 2017, these include;
Each year, the population aged 65 years and over increases by almost 20,000 people, and by over 2,500 for those aged 85 years and over.
This presents a particular challenge for serving a growing and ageing population.
To that end and with cognisance to funding levels a wide range of older person’s services are provided which include home supports, short stay and long stay residential care (Nursing Homes Support Scheme).
In addition to the above both transitional care and day care services are provided where specific pressures exist.
This ensures that appropriate care pathways are in place so services can be delivered at adequate levels, in an integrated manner to meet the needs of older people.
Older Persons Services reported a surplus of €2.6m for 2017.
Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) The number of persons funded under the NHSS at the end of December 2017 was 22,949 which represented an average of 22,983 people in long terms residential care for 2017.
At the end of December, the waiting time for an NHSS place was on target at four weeks with 537 people on the waiting list.
A surplus of €1.2m was reported against this scheme at the end of 2017.
Disability Services
Disability Services reported a deficit of €28.3m at the year-end based.
This deficit relates principally to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability including the provision of emergency placements.
Emergency placements continued to be a significant service pressure in disability services in 2017.
This is in an environment where individual placements can cost up to €0.5m.
The cost is dependent ultimately on the clients need and the complexity of each individual case presenting.
Another driver of the 2017 overspend was the expenditure associated with HIQA compliance, the implementation of quality improvements and action plans arising from HIQA inspection reports.
• The development of three new Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHs) teams.
The development of one new Psychiatry of Later Life (POLL) team.
The opening of the Deer Lodge Special Care Unit.
€3m of investment in service infrastructure.
The advancement of the new National Forensic Services capital project.
Mental Health Engagement Leads appointed in all CHOs.
Launches of the National Recovery Framework, QSUS Best Practice Guidance, local CFL Suicide Prevention Plans, Perinatal MH Model of Care and the Youth Mental Health Taskforce Report.
Notwithstanding the above developments MH also have a number of challenges, namely a high level of agency & overtime due to reduced ability to recruit staff into available posts, and an increasing level of high cost capitation payments relating to residential placements with private providers.
The level of Capitation expenditure is also growing year on year due to the increasing complexity of patients, along with the inability of services to cater for high need clients due to staff shortages and unfilled posts.
Primary Care Services
The final outturn for the Primary Care Services in 2017 was €3,809m including the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.
Core operational services within Primary Care, Social Inclusion and Palliative Care reported a surplus of €6.5m at the end of 2017, largely attributable to once off time related savings, relating mainly to chronic disease clinical posts and palliative care beds not coming on stream as anticipated.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Financial Governance
The Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) reported a balanced financial position for 2017.
The PCRS budget for 2017 was framed by reference to a series of working assumptions which had been developed in detailed discussions with the DOH.
Expenditure was the subject of close monitoring and assessment from the beginning of the year with the main expenditure drivers being Community Drug Schemes and High Tech Medicines.
Health & Wellbeing Services (H&WB) The final outturn for the Health & Wellbeing Services in 2017 was €209m, which included a surplus of €2.8m.
The underspend is reflective of difficulties in recruiting clinical staff such as public health doctors and radiographers.
A wide range of services were provided in H&WB in 2017 which ranged from environmental health services, water fluoridation, public health, health surveillance and protection and the nationally led vaccination programmes (Rotavirus, Men-B, Flu and HPV).
These services were provided in addition to the services offered by office of tobacco control, crisis pregnancy agency and the national screening service.
Financially-Related Initiatives
Finance Reform
Improvement of the HSE’s outdated financial and procurement systems is a strategic priority which is supported by the Finance Reform Programme.
Further significant progress was made, during 2017, in securing the necessary approvals to invest in an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).
The contract was signed in June 2017 for a software platform.
Planning the design and implementation of the single national finance and procurement system will progress in 2018.
Within this over-arching Value Improvement Programme we will focus on three broad priority themes: •
Improving value within existing services;
Improving value within non-direct service areas; and
Strategic value improvement.
While there are a number of opportunities to secure improved value that are within the remit and role of the HSE to deliver, there are others that will require wider consideration of policy, legislation and regulatory issues and therefore will benefit from the involvement and support of the Department of Health and other stakeholders.
Through the Value Improvement Programme, we will target improvement opportunities to address the overall financial challenge while maintaining levels of activity.
The Programme, will seek to improve services while also seeking to mitigate the operational financial challenge in services for 2018.
This should only be delivered via realistic and achievable measures that do not adversely impact services.
The implementation of the Slaintecare Report is a key focus area for 2018 and future years, as well as for the attainment of the goals enshrined in the framework which is set out by the HSE’s Corporate Plan for 2015-2017.
Attainment of the goals will require a focus upon: •
Improving the quality, safety and value of the services we deliver
Prioritising the design and implementation of integrated models of care
Reviewing operational capacity in order to support quality and access for emergency and planned acute care
Progress to the next stage of implementation of the Health Services People Strategy 2015-2018, building on progress to date.
Improvements to ICT, data governance and information governance
Implementation of the CHO and HG Structures
Improvements in financial controls and probity
Implementation of the Finance Reform programme
Addressing the challenges posed by the investment backlog in essential medical equipment and estates infrastructure.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
The Act requires the Committee to meet at least four times in each year and to report in writing, at least once in every year, to the Director General and to the Directorate, on the matters upon which it has advised and on the Committee’s activities during the year.
A copy of this report is to be provided to the Minister.
In accordance with good governance practice, the Audit Committee has in place a Charter which sets out in detail the role, advisory duties and authority of the Committee, along with certain administrative matters.
During 2017, the Committee’s Charter was reviewed in light of the publication by DPER of a revised Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016 which came into effect on the 1st September 2016.
The Audit Committee Charter recognises the establishment by the HSE of a separate Risk Committee, reporting to the Directorate, which is responsible for advising the Directorate on matters relating to all risks principally of a non-financial nature.
The focus of the Audit Committee, in providing its advice to the Directorate and the Director General, is on oversight of and advice on: (i) the HSE’s financial reporting; and (ii) the HSE’s systems of internal financial control and financial risk management.
The Audit Committee also plays a role in promoting good accounting practice, improved and more informed financial decision-making and safeguarding the HSE’s assets and resources through a focus on improving regularity, propriety and value for money throughout the HSE.
Section 33B of the Health Act 2004 as amended by section 11 of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014.
Section 34A of the Health Act 2004 as amended by section 12 of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014.
The publication of the eHealth Strategy for Ireland in late 2013 identified the critical role of eHealth in enabling fundamental reforms of the health service.
The steps taken up to now have enabled the HSE to begin to create a structure that allows eHealth to truly become a catalyst for the reform of health care in Ireland.
The purpose of the eHealth Committee is to support and guide implementation of the eHealth Strategy for Ireland through the implementation of the HSE Knowledge and Information Plan published in March 2015.
The Committee focuses principally on ensuring the provision of expert knowledge, guidance and networking opportunities to the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to aid delivery of its work programme.
Four meetings were held in 2017: •
22nd March – Overview of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Business Case and EHR Governance.
20th September – Key themes for review and discussion were Medication Safety, Medical Laboratory Imaging System (MedLis), Medication Reconciliations
5th December – Key themes for review and discussion were EHR and Primary Care.
The MN CMS was presented on and the Digital Maturity Assessment plan was discussed. The eHealth Ireland committee will review its chair and membership every two years.
In 2017 a patient representative body was appointed to the committee.
The eHealth Ireland Committee publishes its minutes, agendas, and content to the eHealth Ireland web site to build towards an agreed transparency agenda around this area.
Disclosures Required by Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2016)
The Directorate is responsible for ensuring that the HSE has complied with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (‘the Code’), as published by DPER in August 2016.
• Legal Costs and Settlements
Consultancy Costs
Travel and Subsistence – Domestic and International
Hospitality Expenditure.
These additional financial disclosures will be implemented in the 2018 annual financial statements.
This is to allow the necessary amendments, revisions and updates to the current multiple varying financial systems/processes and input forms across the HSE that feed into the production of the annual financial statements data.
Signed on behalf of the HSE
As the Committee works in the early years with the CIO to develop strategies, approaches, priorities and evaluates investments, it expects to meet between three and six times annually.
The eHealth Ireland Committee is supported by a secretariat provided through the OCIO.
The system of internal control is designed to manage and reduce risk rather than to eliminate risk and as such the system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that material errors or irregularities are either prevented or detected in a timely manner.
The system of internal control, which accords with guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been in place in the HSE for the year ended 31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of the financial statements except for the control issues outlined below.
3. Capacity to Handle Risk
The Directorate, as governing body of the HSE, has overall responsibility for the system of internal financial control and risk management.
The Directorate may establish committees to provide assistance and advice in relation to the performance of its duties and functions.
The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 (2013 Act) provides for the establishment of an Audit Committee and any other Committees that the Directorate deem as necessary for the purpose of providing assistance and advice in relation to the performance of the Directorates functions.
The HSE has an Audit Committee* which was established in January 2014 in accordance with the provisions of the 2013 Act.
The membership of the Audit Committee who all have financial and audit expertise, consists of an external Chairperson, four other external members and a member of the HSE Directorate.
The Audit Committee acts in an advisory capacity and has no executive function.
The focus of the Audit Committee in providing advice to the Directorate and the Director General, is on the regularity and propriety of transactions recorded in the accounts and on the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control operated by the HSE.
The Audit Committee operates under an agreed Charter which sets out in detail the role, duties and authority of the Committee.
The Audit Committee is required to meet at least 4 times annually.
In 2017 the Audit Committee met on 7 separate occasions and a joint meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee’s took place on one further occasion.
The HSE has also established an Internal Audit Division with appropriately trained personnel which operates in accordance with a written charter approved by the Directorate.
The National Director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee and to the Director General of the HSE and is a member of the HSE Leadership team.
The work programme of Internal Audit is agreed with the Audit Committee.
During 2017 the Internal Audit Division completed a substantial body of work and issued 158 audit reports.
Particular focus was placed on auditing funded agencies and ICT audits.
A Risk Committee* was established in 2014 in accordance with the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act, 2013.
The Risk Committee, which reports to the Directorate, has an independent chair and comprises a member of the Directorate and four external members.
The Committee operates under agreed Terms of Reference and focuses principally on assisting the Directorate in fulfilling its duties by providing an independent and objective review of non-financial risks.
The Committee kept its terms of reference and work programme under review during the year.
In 2017 the Risk Committee met on 6 separate occasions.
Liaison between the Audit and Risk Committees are facilitated by an annual joint meeting of the two committees and regular engagement between the two Committee Chairs.
Please see Directorate Members Report for additional information regarding these Committees.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Financial Governance
The HSE has developed a risk management policy which clearly defines the roles and responsibilities for all levels of staff in relation to risk, (financial and nonfinancial).
The policy has been updated during 2017 and communicated across all levels of staff.
The HSE is committed to ensuring that risk management is seen as the concern of everyone and is embedded both as part of normal day to day business and informs the strategic and operational planning and performance cycle.
Management at all levels of the HSE are responsible to the Director General for the implementation and maintenance of appropriate and effective internal control in respect of their respective functions and organisations.
This embedding of responsibility for the system of internal control is designed to ensure not only that the HSE is capable of detecting and responding to control issues should they arise, with appropriate escalation protocols, but also that a culture of accountability and responsibility pertains throughout the whole organisation.
has been delegated to the State Claims Agency (SCA) under statute.
The SCA provides specialist advice and risk management to the HSE which is supported by the electronic national incident management reporting system NIMS.
The HSE has in place an internal control framework which is continuously monitored to ensure that there is an effective culture of internal control.
The HSE’s Code of Governance is set out on www.hse.ie and includes the following: •
The Code of Governance reflects the current behavioural standards, policies and procedures to be applied within and by the HSE and the agencies it funds to provide services on its behalf.
The introduction of the accountability framework describes in detail the means by which managers in the health service, including those in Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups (HG) will be held to account for performance in relation to service provision, quality and patient safety, finance and workforce.
There is a framework of administrative procedures in place including segregation of duties, a system of delegation and accountability, a system for the authorisation of expenditure and regular management reporting.
The HSE’s National Financial Regulations form an integral part of the system of internal control and have been designed to be consistent with statutory requirements and to also ensure compliance with public sector guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.
The HSE has in place a devolved annual budgetary system and each year the Minister for Health formally approves the annual service plan.
Defined accountability limits are set which are closely monitored by the National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) on behalf of the Director General.
The HSE has in place a wide range of written policies, procedures, protocols and guidelines in relation to operational and financial controls.
The HSE’s risk management policy involves proactively identifying risks that threaten the achievement of objectives and putting in place actions to reduce these to an acceptable level.
The policy sets out the risk management processes in place and details the roles and responsibilities of staff in relation to risk.
Risk Management is the responsibility of all managers at all levels within the HSE.
Risk registers are in place at key levels in the organisation.
These identify the key risks facing the HSE.
Risks on these registers have been assessed and evaluated according to their significance.
At an organisational level the Corporate Risk Register is subject to monitoring and updating on a quarterly basis.
The risk registers set out the existing controls, the risk rating, any additional controls required to mitigate each risk and assigns both persons and timescales for completion of these.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Additionally an annual Controls Assurance Statement (CAS) must be completed by all senior management.
This statement requires management to confirm that they are aware of and comply with the key financial controls and code of governance in place within the HSE. Financial Governance
5. Ongoing Monitoring and Review
Formal procedures have been established for monitoring control processes and control deficiencies are communicated to those responsible for taking corrective action and to the Directorate and Senior Management.
I confirm that the following ongoing monitoring systems are in place: •
Key risks and related controls have been identified and processes have been put in place to monitor the operation of those key controls and report any identified deficiencies.
Reporting arrangements have been established at all levels where responsibility for financial management has been assigned
There are regular reviews by senior management of periodic and annual performance and financial reports indicating HSE performance against budgets/forecasts
There are regular reviews by the Department of Health (DOH) of the HSE’s performance in terms of budget and service plans.
The National Performance Oversight Group (NPOG) has delegated authority from the Director General to serve as a key performance and accountability oversight and scrutiny process for the HSE and to support the Director General and the Directorate in overseeing and driving the performance of the HSE’s Divisions.
In addition to internal monitoring the HSE also has regular meetings with the DOH to jointly review performance.
Key service and financial performance is reviewed with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) via a monthly Senior Officials Group (SOG) and also Cabinet Committee on Health (CCOH).
The work of Internal Audit forms an important part of the monitoring of the internal control system within the HSE.
The annual work plan of Internal Audit is informed by analysis of the key risks to which the HSE is exposed and is approved by the Audit Committee.
The National Director of Internal Audit attends all Audit Committee meetings and has regular one to one meetings with the Chairperson of the Audit Committee as well as the Director General.
Monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the HSE’s internal controls is also informed by the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
Comments and recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his management letters, audit certs or annual reports are reviewed by the Directorate and Leadership Team and actions are taken to implement recommendations.
Review of their implementation is monitored by NPOG, on behalf of the Directorate, with input from the Audit Committee.
In addition a National Financial Controls Assurance Group (NFCAG) was also established in 2015 in order to address a number of recurring control weaknesses identified as part of the annual audit of the financial statements and by internal audit and other external reviews.
Since 2015 this group has focused on addressing issues in relation to procurement, taxation, prompt payment interest, pay-related overpayments and cash handling.
This group reports to NPOG.
Annually the HSE requires all relevant senior staff at Grade VIII (or equivalent) and above to complete an internal control questionnaire which is designed to provide essential feedback in respect of key control areas.
This allows the HSE to monitor the effectiveness of key controls and to direct remediation activity where required.
The HSE has procedures in place to ensure compliance with current procurement rules and guidelines.
Matters arising regarding controls over procurement are highlighted under the heading internal control issues.
Procurement
In procuring goods and services, all areas within the HSE must comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE’s National Financial Regulations.
HSE Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Financial Governance
Currently there are central contracts in place covering annual expenditure of €1.1bn which is up €454m or 72% on the value of contracts registered as at the end of 2016.
Key components of this Sourcing plan relate to: •
On-going development of the Procurement Project management system (PPMS) which will support HSE staff with progressing procurement.
Continuing development of the Pricing & Assisted Sourcing System (PASS) which will continue to assist HSE staff by improving access and visibility of current contracts.
HBS Procurement has developed the Data Warehouse System to provide visibility of product data and usage including price comparison across legacy systems.

Statement of Strategy 2016 – 2019
Foreword by the Minister
The Government wants to use the benefits of a strong economy to deliver a fair society.
This means investing in rebuilding and reforming key public services, like health – the services that people depend on and want to see supported.
Our longterm vision is to allow everyone to enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential.
This Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health sets out a range of actions to pursue that agenda over the period 2016-2019.
These actions are organised under five major strategic objectives.
The Statement reflects the health commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.
This Strategy has also been informed by changing healthcare needs.
We have an ageing population.
People are living longer which means their needs will become greater, more diverse and more complex.
We also have the highest birth rate in Europe.
These trends are very welcome for Irish society as a whole.
They also, however, generate increased demand for services.
We must recognise and address the problems patients face trying to access services whether from emergency departments or from waiting lists; the severe pressure on very dedicated staff; and increasing demand and pressure on resources.
Actions in this Strategy are aimed at addressing these challenges by improving health and wellbeing and supporting independent living, delivering high quality and safe care which is more responsive, integrated and person-centred, and better managing our health services.
I have been very clear on the need for a long-term vision for our health and social care services and the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare provides an opportunity for political, and indeed societal, consensus on our future direction.
While there are many challenges and difficulties to deal with, we must also acknowledge the many improvements that have been made and recognise those who work so hard across the whole health and social care sector.
For example, we have seen life expectancy in Ireland increase by two and a half years since 2004 to where it is now above the EU average.
We have seen mortality rates for circulatory system and respiratory diseases fall, an improvement in cancer care, and significant progress in reducing tobacco consumption.
We are lucky to have a committed and skilled staff in our health services.
I look forward to working with them, the Secretary General and staff of the Department, and Ministers of State McGrath, Corcoran Kennedy, Byrne and McEntee, as we continue to develop a high-performing Department to lead and oversee the sector and to deliver on our aims.
Introduction by the Secretary General This Statement of Strategy is submitted to the Minister for Health under Section 5(1) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.
It sets out an ambitious range of actions to improve health outcomes and the health services over the life of this Strategy.
These actions will be reported on annually and we will be held accountable for the progress we deliver.
The Department has been undergoing a significant organisational change programme, Working Better Together, since 2015.
This will continue during this Strategy period to ensure we are as effective as possible in fulfilling our role and delivering on the ambitions in this Strategy.
The development of this Strategy Statement has been informed by consultations with the public, stakeholders, departmental agencies, other Government departments and our staff.
Thank you for your contributions to this consultation.
Thank you in particular to the staff of the Department for their ongoing commitment and readiness to embrace the full potential in our role to contribute to the achievement of a Healthy Ireland and improvement in our health services.

Background and Context
This is the Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health for the period 2016-2019.
It describes the current environment in which health and social services are to be delivered and identifies a number of underlying themes that will inform our work over the three year period.
Finally, it outlines the actions we will take, organised into five Strategic Objectives.
This Statement of Strategy takes account of the Programme for a Partnership Government.
It also reflects the ongoing health reform programme and other broader Government strategies such as the Public Service Reform Plan, the Civil Service Renewal Plan and action plans on Jobs, Housing and Homelessness and Education.
It has been informed by a wide consultation process carried out during the development of this Strategy.
We have also set the development of our own staff and our own capability as a distinct strategic objective.
Through our major change programme, Working Better Together, we are working towards achieving a Department that is: focused on priority outcomes; evidence-informed; responsible and accountable; supportive of staff in giving their best and taking the initiative; committed to the learning, personal and career development of all staff; and open in sharing information relevant for others.
Ultimately, the vision of the change programme is a better environment in which to deliver our work, where on an on-going basis high performance is achieved, where collaborative working is promoted, and where we can all develop our knowledge and skills.
Implementing the programme is a key enabler for achieving our other strategic objectives and how we are doing this is set out under Strategic Objective 5.
Our Mission:
 keeping people healthy;
 providing the healthcare people need;
 delivering high quality services;
and  getting best value from health system resources.
Our Values :
A deep-rooted public service ethos of independence, integrity, impartiality, equality, fairness and respect
A culture of accountability, efficiency and value for money
The highest standards of professionalism, leadership and rigour
Operating Environment – Opportunities and Challenges
The Department operates in a highly complex environment, providing a leadership role for a very diverse and broad sector with a multiplicity of stakeholders.
Over the next three years this environment will be shaped by a number of factors including:
Economic: The last number of years have seen a sustained return of economic growth.
This recovery is providing the basis for renewed investment in vital public services, including health and social care.
While significant additional investment will be provided to the sector over 2016 and 2017, economic risks and fiscal constraints remain.
Continued economic growth in the coming years is projected which will allow for further improvements in public services.
However, EU Fiscal Rules will constrain the rate of growth in spending, requiring us to be as effective as possible in meeting existing and new population health demands.
Political: The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out an ambitious programme for all aspects of the health and social care sector spanning 139 individual commitments.
Its overarching priority is to increase access to safe, timely care, as close to people’s homes as possible.
The Programme also committed to the development by an All-Party Oireachtas Committee of a single long term vision for healthcare over a 10 year period with cross party consensus.
The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established in June 2016 and is due to report in January 2017.
International: The UK’s decision to leave the EU will require the agreement of new arrangements for cross border sevices and cooperation in the area of health.
The Department will strive to ensure that Irish people’s interests are protected in negotiations to agree a new arrangement between the UK and the EU.
Ensuring that there is minimum disruption in the area of health and that essential services are maintained will be our key priority.
Demand Pressures: Health and social care services continue to face huge demographic pressures and a rising burden of chronic disease.
The overall population has been rising steadily in the last decade and is projected to increase by 4.9% by 2021.
Source: CSO – “Population and Labour
The population is also ageing (see Population Pyramid graph) – resulting in greater care requirements.
Projections suggest that between 2011 and 2021, the population aged 65 and over will increase by 38%, while the number of people aged over 85 years is currently increasing by approximately 3.3% each year.1 Coupled with these demographic pressures, the changing nature and complexity of care required is placing further pressures on the system.
An ageing population and lifesytle factors are contributing to a sharp increase in the prevalence of chronic disease with multiple morbidities.
Approximately 38% of Irish people over 50 years have one chronic disease and 11% have more than one.
Civil Service Renewal Plan: This provides a framework for renewing the Civil Service and enabling the building of capacity and improving the performance of the Civil Service and its staff.
Human Rights & Equality: The Department is conscious of its responsibility in ensuring that the principles of the Public Sector Duty in relation to human rights and equality are embedded across the work of the Department.
An example of this is the Department’s commitment to the creation of a more responsive, integrated and people-centred social care system which (amongst other things) supports the full and effective participation of people with disabilities in society on an equal basis with others, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (see Independent Living section on page 7 under Objective 1).
Collaboration with other Departments and Public Sector Bodies: Continuing to develop strong working relationships with other Departments and Bodies, including agencies under the aegis of the Department (see Appendix 2), will be critical to achieving many of the Department’s and wider Government objectives.
National Risk Assessment: The National Risk Assessment published by Department of the Taoiseach identifies a number of risks with health implications, including economic risks, effects of Brexit, climate change and extreme weather events, food safety, increase in chronic disease, major pandemics, nuclear contamination, and anti-microbial resistance.
The Department also adheres to the four principles relating to Governance, Structures, Management and Reporting and the associated guidelines contained in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform’s Risk Management Guidance for Government Departments (Feb 2016).
Official Languages Act: The Department is fully committed to facilitating people who wish to conduct their business with us through Irish.
In that context the Department is compliant with the Official Languages Act 2003 including the publication of this Statement of Strategy bilingually.

Strategic Objectives - Introduction
This Statement of Strategy has been prepared in accordance with the Public Service Management Act of 1997.
As such, it is not a strategy for the Health Service, but rather a corporate strategy statement focused on the work and activities of the Department of Health.
Nonetheless, the overall Mission of the Department, which was set out in our last Statement of Strategy and which remains valid for the three year period ahead, is to improve the health and wellbeing of people in Ireland by:    
keeping people healthy; providing the healthcare people need; delivering high quality services; and getting best value from health system resources.
In 2016, the Department prepared a paper entitled Better Health, Improving Health Care, which set out a strategic perspective for the incoming Minister for Health.
In addition, a significant number of actions have been assigned to the Department under the Programme for a Partnership Government.
A number of underlying themes in these documents have informed the development of this Statement of Strategy, including the following:
Changing Healthcare Needs: Life expectancy has improved significantly in Ireland in the past decade.
Between 2003 and 2014, life expectancy in Ireland for males increased from 75.7 years to 79.3 years and for females from 80.7 to 83.5 years (source: Eurostat).
This is a positive development which reflects, in part, improvements in healthcare.
When combined with the feed-through of changes in migration flows that took place in the 1960s, however, this change means that the number of older people in Ireland is increasing rapidly, with significant consequences for demand for healthcare and social care services.
In common with other advanced economies, Ireland is also experiencing a rise in the burden of chronic disease, i.e. conditions which are not acquired from someone else, and which are of long duration.
Approximately 38% of Irish people over 50 years have one chronic disease, and 11% have more than one.
Chronic disease accounts for 80% of all GP visits, 40% of hospital admissions, and 75% of hospital bed days.
As the number of older people increases, the number of people with chronic disease will increase, and the numbers with more than one chronic disease will pose a particular challenge to the existing model of care.
Requiring a new Model of Care: This changing pattern of need poses a particular challenge to our model of care.
Historically, health services in Ireland have evolved from a system which has been fragmented, overly hospital-centric, and focused on delivering episodes of care.
The ongoing challenge is to develop a model of care which is more integrated and continuous, person-centred, and delivered at the lowest level of complexity consistent with patient safety.
The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a decisive shift towards Primary Care in the delivery of health services in Ireland, which may be seen as a core component in the development of a more integrated health service.
Primary care must be developed, and should have an explicit coordination and case management role, while on-going change and reform in other parts of the health service will also be required to develop a more integrated, person-centred service.
Deepening our understanding of how the model of care needs to change is an essential component in assessing the requirement for on-going investment in the health service, since additional capacity cannot substitute for improvements in the way care is delivered to people if we are to meet growing demand in the most affordable way possible.
In the early part of this strategy period, the Department will undertake a number of projects which focus on specifying the preferred model of care in Ireland across a number of service settings.
5 Combining short-term action with long-term focus: A large component of the Department’s work will continue to be related to the immediate challenges in the health services.
These include improving Patient Experience Times (PET) in emergency departments and addressing the challenge of waiting lists.
At the same time, achieving sustained and sustainable progress in addressing service needs depends on the achievement of broader reform over the medium and long-term.
This includes population health measures under the umbrella of Healthy Ireland, changing the underlying model of care, and delivering on reforms to the management structure of the health service.
In the case of the latter, reform has to be delivered in a manner which is consistent with the on-going delivery of services.
In terms of longer term vision, the Oireachtas has established the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare which is expected to complete its work early in 2017 and to provide further direction in relation to overall health and social care policy.
Performance and Accountability: A key theme of the Statement of Strategy is the need to maintain and enhance oversight of the service-delivery system, and in particular the implementation of the new Performance and Accountability Framework for the Health Service Executive (HSE).
This is one of a number of developments in the structure of operational supports for the health service which the Department is supporting.
Over time, the Department is seeking to develop a population-based framework for the formulation and implementation of evidence-informed policy and the planning, organisation and evaluation of health services.
This requires greater focus by planners, providers and the health workforce on population health needs as well as responsiveness to changes in such needs.
The 5 strategic objectives outlined below (table 1) are informed by these themes, and are aimed both at continuing the existing reform process, and on the implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government.
It is important to note that to one extent or another, these objectives are inter-related and inter-dependent.
While many initiatives are already policy priorities, there is now a need for deeper and more systemic change and implementation within our system.
As this Statement of Strategy addresses a period of three years, there is a need for consideration of Departmental priorities for each year of the Strategy.
It is intended that this will be facilitated through a new Annual Departmental Statement of Priorities.
The Statement of Priorities will be an output of the annual business planning process and will list the Department’s priority outputs to be delivered during the year, including timelines for delivery.
Table 1:
5 Strategic Objectives:
Clinical Effectiveness
Ensuring safe, high quality care services requires the Department to consider the most appropriate evidence-based decision making processes for policy that can promote the achievement of best possible health outcomes for a given level of investment.
To this end, the work of the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) in recent years has developed a structured, systematic approach to the prioritisation, development and quality assurance of national clinical guidelines.
This work encompasses decision-making frameworks around systematic evidence reviews, budget impact analysis and strategies to consider both feasibility and drivers of policy implementation.
The NCEC will continue to develop its programme of work on guidelines for patient safety and quality.
A structured and systematic approach to wider decision making in the Department, employing standardised criteria and processes such as systematic evidence reviews and budget impact analyses has the potential to improve the quality of decision making, inform prioritisation and policy development and demonstrate transparency and accountability in decision making.
The work of the NCEC as outlined above provides a useful model for the potential value of this approach.
For this broader Departmental work we will, over the next three years, review and develop the decision making processes which support policy development and prioritisation in a number of key patient facing areas, including for example, immunisation policy, screening and other population based preventive programmes, policies relating to the use of blood, organs and other tissues, health promotion and improvement guidelines e.g. exercise, healthy eating, alcohol consumption and the use of medications (new and existing).
Sustainability and Budgeting
The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out our intention to work with the Oireachtas to sustain appropriate annual increases in the Health Budget.
Expenditure will be based on multi-year budgeting supported by a five year Health Service Plan based on realistic and verifiable projections.
The development of a 5 year plan will take account of the deliberations of the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.
The funding increases provided in recent years to the HSE, and the HSE's enhanced Performance and Accountability framework, provide an important basis for planning health expenditure and the operation of the health services within the limits determined by the Oireachtas.
Health Service Structures and Governance The health service is currently embarked on a major programme of change.
Over the last number of years, seven Hospital Groups3 have been created (with approximately six to eleven hospitals in each group) and nine Community Health Organisations4 (CHO) which manage primary, community and social care services.
The development of these Hospital Groups and CHO structures also raises questions about the long-term future development of HSE Corporate.
The Programme for a Partnership Government states “We will continue the process of dismantling the HSE, evolving it into a Health Commission”.
The Minister for Health has indicated that he will not pursue further structural reforms pending the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. Workforce Planning and Skill Mix
The largest component of health expenditure is represented by the pay costs of staff.
In a situation of financial constraints and global shortage of particular health professionals, it is important that as a country we achieve an optimum skill mix, a positive work environment to attract and retain staff and very good output from all the staff resources deployed.
A National Integrated Strategic Framework for Health Workforce Planning is being developed in association with the HSE, the education sector and professional regulators to guide the planning of the health workforce into the future.
eHealth
Information technology is an essential tool in the modernisation of health service delivery and in enabling the connection required amongst service users, professionals and organisations to achieve integrated care.
It is also increasingly critical in supporting patient safety.
A number of important elements have recently been put into place such as The Office of the Chief Information Officer (in the HSE), the eHealth Ireland Advisory Committee and the Clinical Information Officers Council.
An overall eHealth Strategy was published in 2013 and the Health Innovation Hub Ireland was launched in 2016.
The Health Identifier Act has been enacted providing the legal basis for a single health identifier for every member of the public, to support patient safety and the eHealth agenda.
A legislative basis to protect and improve the management, use and access to sensitive patient health information is also required to ensure the eHealth environment aligns with the new EU Regulation on Data Protection.
Further legislative actions and investment in eHealth will be a key priority for the period of this strategy, over the course of which we will work in partnership with the HSE and eHealth Ireland to establish a national electronic health record at the heart of a more connected and integrated health service.
The Department is progressing the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill which among other matters sets out a regulatory framework for health information resources and data-matching programmes.
Modernising Health Facilities
Suitable and appropriate facilities are required to support health and social care delivery across the sector, particularly as the balance shifts from a hospital-centric service to one located more in the community.
There is a range of capital projects on-going and planned over the next three year period, including development of the key priority projects as outlined in the Actions table below, which are designed to complement the overall effort to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of the health services.
Funding Models
The Programme for a Partnership Government confirmed the Government’s continued commitment to the implementation of Activity Based Funding (ABF, previously known as Money Follows the Patient) – a model whereby hospitals and other healthcare providers are funded based on the quality and quantity of the services they deliver for patients as opposed to historical budgets.
Linking budgets with activity will drive efficiency and increase transparency in the provision of high quality services for patients.
We will work with the HSE to ensure that ABF is further developed and that: the model is expanded to encompass outpatient activity; the model commences linking provider payments with clinical objectives; and the building blocks required to determine the cost of community services are developed.
We will also work with the HSE to develop a new ABF Implementation Plan for the period after 2017.
The Department will continue work in relation to the development of a healthcare commissioning model that will be appropriate and beneficial within the Irish context, and that links resources to the assessed needs of patients and clients, and ensures clear accountability throughout the system.
Private Health Insurance
Another important driver of activity in the health system is private health insurance, held by almost half of the population.
In line with Government policy, the Department seeks to promote a sustainable, community-rated voluntary private health insurance market.
The Department oversees the regulation of the market and the system of risk equalisation required to support community-rating.
The Department will continue work to improve the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme by introducing a more refined measure of health status.
We will also continue to monitor market developments to ensure that the health needs of insured people are met in an efficient and effective manner.
The Department also has a particular role in relation to the VHI and wil continue appropriate oversight arrangements.
Securing Cost-Effective Access to Medicines for People Medicines play a key role in improving the health of people in Ireland.
5. Develop a high-performing Department to lead and oversee the health and social care sector Civil Service Renewal and Working Better Together Organisational Change Programme
We are fully committed to the ongoing programme of change in the Civil Service, including through the Working Better Together Change Programme which will be a core element in our Department’s contribution to Civil Service Renewal.
The Department has embarked on a significant change programme entitled Working Better Together since 2015.
The programme’s vision is 'a better environment in which to deliver our work, where on an on-going basis high performance is achieved, where collaborative working is promoted, and where we can all develop our knowledge and skills'.
It is working towards achieving a Department which is:
1. Focused on priority outcomes – using our knowledge and skills to solve problems in collaboration with others;
2. Evidence-informed – using data and research to make better policies and decisions;
3. Responsible and accountable – where we have high standards for ourselves and others, we work together to demonstrate the achievement of these standards and we are accountable to each other for the quality and timeliness of our work, particularly where others are depending on our input;
4. Supportive of staff in giving of their best and taking initiative - giving credit where it is due;
5. Committed to the learning, personal and career development of all staff – including our own personal development - and supportive of people’s health and wellbeing;
6. Open in sharing information relevant for others and collaborating across and outside the organisation.
Following a structured process of consultation, engagement and design with staff, the Department was restructured during 2015 and an integrated programme of 14 change actions has been agreed for 2016/2017.
A Management Board Sub-Committee, chaired by the Secretary General and representative of all levels of the Department, has been established to oversee implementation of these actions.
An Implementation Support Unit is also in place to support implementation of the change programme.
Enhanced Policy-Making Capabilities and Strengthened Oversight The Department is strengthening its capacity in a number of areas, including policy making, strategy development, research and analytics, strategic oversight and governance, and its programme and project management.
As part of the Department’s restructuring, new cross-Department structures and processes have been established which will further these aims over the coming years, such as :     
New corporate divisions for governance and performance, and for policy and strategy A new division for Research and Development and Health Analytics A new Management Board sub-committee for policy development A new National Patient Safety Office The Department’s Programme Management Office and the HSE are designing a programme management approach to the ongoing health system improvement agenda.
Improvements in Research, Analytics and Evaluation The R&D and Health Analytics Division, encompassing a statistical and analytics service, will play a critical role in supporting the Department to further develop its evidence-informed approach to policy development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The Department will lead on strategy for research and innovation in the health sector.
Health research is key to achieving the objectives of the health system.
It delivers knowledge, insights and evidence to address challenges.
In particular, the Department will continue to support the Health Research Board in implementing its Strategy 2016-2020 Research Evidence Action.
In addition, the new Research Services Unit within the R&D and Health Analytics Division will ensure that research and evaluation is at the core of policy formulation and decision making within the Department itself. This unit will provide research support 21
and advice for policy units, supported by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), will manage internal and external research programmes aligned with departmental priorities and will act as a broker to harness learning and insights from the research community (national and international) to inform the work of the Department on key issues.
Under the current public spending code the Department is required to work with the HSE on the rolling value for money (VFM) assessment of spending programmes.
This will be in the form of VFM and Policy Reviews and smaller Focused Policy Assessments.
This will be a significant evaluation undertaking given the range of programmes and scale of spending in health, and the level of analysis required.
Governance Framework for the Department of Health The Department's Governance Framework has been drafted in accordance with the Corporate Governance Standard for the Civil Service5.
The objectives of this Governance Framework are to ensure that:  the Department’s systems of accountability and responsibility are effective, robust, clear, and identifiable, and  the Department evolves so that it can better adapt to social, political, environmental and economic changes.
The Department’s governance arrangements are underpinned by a compliance process based on good knowledge management as well as monitoring and review arrangements.
The Department is developing a Governance Compliance Framework in accordance with best practice and it will have regard to the Risk Management Guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2016.
It will also work to strengthen governance arrangements for the bodies under its aegis (See Appendix 2) to ensure they comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform’s Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies (August 2016).

However, as a result of the enormous sacrifices made by people, our economy is now recovering.
There are more people at work, more trade is being done, and more new businesses are opening.
The Government wants to sustain the recovery, make it real for more people, and extend it to all regions.
That means more money in people's pockets, getting back to full employment, investing in infrastructure, and rebuilding and reforming public services like health.
I have set out five major themes for action over the next few years.
These include Healthy Ireland - improving our health and wellbeing as individuals and as a nation; improving patient outcomes and patient safety; moving towards universal health care; investing in IT and modernising our infrastructure; and embedding structural and financial reforms.
This Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health sets out a range of actions to pursue that agenda over the period 2015-2017.
Our most important resource is our people and we are lucky to have a committed and skilled staff in our health services.
I look forward to working with them, the Secretary General and staff of the Department, and Minister of State Lynch, to deliver on our aims.
Minister for Health
Introduction by the Secretary General
Health is intrinsic to the life of our fellow citizens and working in the Department of Health provides us with the opportunity to improve health outcomes and the health and social care services.
This Statement of Strategy is submitted to the Minister for Health under Section 5(1) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.
It sets out a range of ambitious and important initiatives.
We will report upon and be held accountable for delivery of these actions.
Where opportunities and resources allow, we will go further - all the time, providing leadership intended to improve health outcomes and the health services over the life of this Strategy.

Introduction
1. This is the Statement of Strategy for the Department of Health 2015-2017.
We identify the main risks, challenges and opportunities we face.
We then set out the actions we will take, organised into seven priority areas.
2. This Government set out an ambitious reform agenda for the health sector, founded on the commitment to establish a single-tier health service where access to services is based on need and not on ability to pay.
This Statement of Strategy takes account of that reform agenda and the Statement of Government Priorities, July 2014 (See Appendix A).
It also incorporates Government policy commitments set out in Future Health and Healthy Ireland:
A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 as well as Patient Safety First, the Public Service Reform Plan and the Civil Service Renewal Plan.
Our Aim
3. Our overall aim is to improve the health and wellbeing of people in Ireland by:
providing the healthcare people need;
delivering high quality services;
and getting best value from health system resources.
4. The core aim of health policy must be to improve the health and wellbeing of people in Ireland.
It encompasses increasing healthy behaviours, focussing on prevention and early detection, reducing health inequalities and improving the health status of vulnerable groups and providing children with a healthy start to life, helping older people, those with disabilities and those affected by mental illness to live as independently as possible.
5. While we seek to address health and wellbeing, we must also ensure that people can access the healthcare they need when they need it and where they need it.
This encompasses improving access to emergency care, shorter waiting times, delivering services as close to home as possible and enabling prompt and fair access to those services.
6. The services delivered must be of the highest quality to ensure patient safety.
Care must be delivered in the right setting with high quality clinical treatment delivered consistently and on an integrated basis.
7. Finally, and particularly given the financial constraints we must deal with, we must get best value from our resources through strong corporate and clinical governance, sound resource and financial management, skilled and motivated staff working in a nurturing and sustainable environment.
We need to ensure that policy and practice are informed by appropriate health research and evidence.
8. We have a range of actions that we plan to pursue over the lifetime of this strategy to achieve our aim.
We’ve organised these actions into priority areas, set out below.
It’s important to note that to one extent or another all of these actions are interrelated and interdependent.
Drive the Healthy Ireland agenda
Deliver improved patient outcomes
Reform operational systems to drive better outcomes
Implement agreed steps towards universal healthcare
Introduce innovative funding models
Modernise health facilities and ICT infrastructure
9. We must measure our progress so we know if we have succeeded.
Some actions are self-explanatory in terms of progress, like building primary care centres, but others require different types of measures, like gathering and analysing patients’ experiences of services provided or measuring patient health outcomes.
Performance measures are set out as part of our Action Plan (see Appendix C).
10. As a separate priority area (Develop the Department’s workforce and capability), we’ve set out how we plan to develop our own workforce and our own capability.
We want to become an employer of choice.
We want to empower our own staff to be the best that they can be, for themselves, and in order to enhance our ability to lead the health services in the short, medium and longer-terms.
The Department of Health – Role and Main Functions
11. Our distinct role is fourfold.
We provide leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes.
We deliver governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high quality services.
Leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes
 fully leverage the knowledge, skills and support of the entire health system in developing agreed objectives
 develop communication strategies to represent the value of health policies, services and outcomes
 promote and monitor system progress in achieving health and social outcomes Governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high quality services
 lead in the design and architecture of the whole health sector  set and communicate priorities and performance standards
 lead the negotiation of resources and ensure they are allocated in furtherance of value for money obligations associated with public funds
 implement performance oversight systems and techniques to hold the system to account through goal definition, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment
 support the Minister, Minister of State and Department officials in fulfilling accountability to the Oireachtas and the public
An organisational environment where, on an ongoing basis, high performance is achieved and the knowledge and skills of staff are developed
 implement excellent systems of internal communication to promote organisationwide knowledge of goals, values, strategy and processes and facilitate staff in contributing to organisational innovation and success
 provide support services and a work environment which ensure that all staff are valued to give of their best and provided with opportunities to learn and develop
 ensure performance is assessed and managed effectively at individual, team and corporate level
 gain recognition for our commitment to a supportive, high performance work environment amongst our staff and across the civil service and within the health sector
 support staff in accessing better evidence and the views of citizens
13. It is acknowledged that, in supporting the Minister and the Government, a very significant part of the Department’s day-to-day activities involve the preparation of information for the Oireachtas.
These activities cut across all dimensions of the role of the Department outlined above, particularly so in relation to that of governance and performance oversight of services.
14. In 2014, the staff of the Department prepared almost 3,500 replies to parliamentary questions (and another 4,200 were processed for direct reply by the HSE) and 5,300 responses to Ministerial representations.
We prepared information for 630 topical issues and Seanad adjournments and 429 briefing notes for Leaders Questions.
234 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests were responded to.
Although not spread evenly across the Department’s 339 staff, that represents an average of almost 30 such activities per staff member, in addition to their other duties.
Our Values
15. In 2014, the Government published the Civil Service Renewal Plan.
The success of the Plan depends on the involvement and commitment of Civil Service staff, including the staff of this Department.
It will require collective ownership, strong leadership and good programme management.
It will also require a commitment to shared values and so we undertake to be guided by the shared values of civil service renewal:
A deep-rooted public service ethos of independence, integrity, impartiality, equality, fairness and respect
A culture of accountability, efficiency and value for money The highest standards of professionalism, leadership and rigour.
Organisational Analysis
16. Like other Departments, our workload has increased, while staff numbers have reduced.
Over the last five years, through retirements, incentivised schemes and the transfer of functions to the newly established Department of Children and Youth Affairs, staff numbers have reduced from 540 WTEs to 339.
In all, 90 staff retired and 92 transferred to DCYA, with the balance moving elsewhere in the civil service.
To deal with this additional pressure and improve our effectiveness it is necessary for us to focus on organisational development.
17. This organisational development programme includes improved role definition and prioritisation
– both documented in the Strategy
– and improved internal communication and staff engagement, effective staff development, better systems for organising, allocating and managing staff and evaluating performance.
18. In line with the corporate priorities set out in the Statement of Strategy, we are currently realigning resources and changing organisational structure.
The Department is also in the process of developing a comprehensive workforce plan for 2015 to equip the Department to deliver on its objectives.
Health reform to date
19. The publication of the 2011 Programme for Government set out an ambitious reform agenda for the health services at a time of great economic and financial challenge.
We set out how we would achieve these reforms in 2012, in Future Health:
A Strategic Framework for the Health Services 2012-2015.
Future Health is the Government’s policy for reforming the health services and is complemented by:
Patient Safety First and Healthy Ireland, the national framework for improving the health and wellbeing of people in Ireland; and, our ongoing commitment to improving patient safety.
20. In Future Health, we set out plans to implement the Government’s objective of a singletier health service, to enable the population have equal access to healthcare based on need, not income.
This included the introduction of universal primary care, including GP care without fees for all and universal hospital care.
In order to deliver the reform while maintaining access and quality the reforms were planned on a phased basis – a series of separate projects organised and managed together.
Specific reforms in place or being delivered include:
The Government published the Healthy Ireland framework to improve the health and wellbeing of people in Ireland and implementation is underway
We prepared legislation, now implemented, to establish the HSE Directorate and return the HSE Vote to the Department to enhance accountability and efficiency.
The legislation to provide GP care without fees to all children under 6 years of age is in place.
The Government approved a plan for reforming primary and continuing care with implementation of new Community Healthcare Organisations now commenced.
Hospital Groups are also being established, with CEOs and Chairs of Boards appointed;
We published a policy paper on Activity Based Funding (also known as Money Follows the Patient) and we are overseeing its implementation by the HSE.
The White Paper on Universal Health Insurance (UHI) is now being costed and a roadmap for next steps developed.
Measures are being put in place to improve the private health insurance market including a new Risk Equalisation Scheme, Lifetime Community Rating and more attractive rates for young adults.
The National eHealth Strategy was published and is being implemented and the Health Identifier Act was enacted ; We have implemented key patient safety and quality reforms through the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and through the HSE.
Environmental Analysis
21. Since we published our last Statement of Strategy, the economy has started to turn around and employment has begun to increase.
Arising out of Budget 2015, we are in a two year process which stabilises the budget and allows for existing levels of service to continue, along with some targeted enhancements.
There is a modest increase in the 2015 Health budget, the first increase in seven years.
The spending ceiling for health in 2016 has also already been increased upwards by a further €174 million.
However, the period of this strategy still remains a real challenge.
There are significant cost pressures and unmet needs.
Drivers of demand and cost include our rising and ageing population and the increase in chronic conditions and advances in medical technology come at a higher price.
Our progress in diagnosis and screening for cancers and chronic diseases means more people are identified who require treatments.
Health services all around the world are struggling with the effects of the downturn, rising costs and increased demand and Ireland is not exempt.
22. Over the past decade, life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost three years (consistently higher than the EU average).
Much of this increase is due to significant reductions in major causes of death.
Since 2004, there has been a reduction in mortality rates for most major causes and an 18% reduction overall in the same period.
These increases point to improvements in general health and the health services have played and will continue to play a large part in these improvements.
Ireland also continues to have the highest levels of self-perceived health of any EU country.
23. Despite reductions in the numbers of births in recent years, the fertility rate in Ireland remains the highest in the EU.
In terms of ageing, Ireland is now beginning to catch up with other European countries.
The population of those aged 65 years and over has been increasing at a faster rate than our EU neighbours - by 20,000 people annually - and is expected to almost double in the next 20 years, with the greatest proportional increase in the 85+ age group.
24. This trend will have implications for future planning and health service delivery.
Rapid ageing of the population in conjunction with lifestyle-related health threats present major challenges now and for the future in sustaining and improving health and health services in Ireland.
In order to support our ageing population to maximise their health and wellbeing, we need to provide comprehensive primary and community care services, which allow them to remain in their local communities for as long as possible.
Lifestyle related health threats which impact on all of our population – the young, middle-aged and elderly - are increasing the range and type of chronic diseases our health and personal social care services have to deal with and we must strengthen primary care as the most effective setting for supporting the population in disease prevention and management.
Drive the Healthy Ireland Agenda
25. A key part of improving the health of our population is to focus on prevention, early intervention and empowering people to look after their own health and wellbeing.
In 2013, the Government approved Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025 and implementation is underway.
Healthy Ireland isn’t just a strategy for the Department of Health or the health services.
Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people’s lives.
Our vision is a Healthy Ireland, where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential, where wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society and is everyone’s responsibility.
Healthy Ireland’s goals are to:
Increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life Reduce health inequalities
Protect the public from threats to health and wellbeing Create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland
26. There are a number of public health challenges which we must address like obesity, tobacco and the misuse of alcohol.
Our goal in relation to obesity is to increase the number of adults and children with a healthy weight.
Our policy on smoking is set out in Tobacco Free Ireland.
It is to promote and move towards a tobacco free society by 2025.
Tobacco Free Ireland was the first policy document to be launched under the Healthy Ireland framework.
In 2012, we published the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy and in 2015, it is planned to introduce an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, including the drafting of a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.
Measures to be implemented include minimum unit pricing for alcohol products, the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and health labelling of alcohol products.
27. With cancer incidence projected to double by 2040, the growth in demand for cancer services will continue to increase, particularly in view of an ageing population.
A key task in the coming years will be to work to prevent cancer occurring in the first place as far as possible and to tackle cancer early when it does occur.
That is why we are developing a third cancer strategy, for publication in 2016, which will provide the focus for cancer control for the next decade.
28. Our specific deliverables in driving the Healthy Ireland agenda over the next three years are:
Public Health (Alcohol) Bill
Legislation for the sale of tobacco products and non-medicinal delivery systems
Commence the Protection of Children’s Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act 2014
Transposition of the EU Tobacco Products Directive
Implement the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012
Implement Tobacco Free Ireland
Publish the first Healthy Ireland survey
Publish an obesity policy
Publish a new national drugs strategy
Lead implementation of health commitments in Better Outcomes Brighter Futures
– the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People
Work with the HSE to complete a climate change adaptation plan for the health sector
Progress the achievement of the highest standards of food safety by ensuring that an appropriate legal framework, policies and relevant structures are in place.
Protect the health and safety of the public with regard to medicinal products, cosmetics and medical devices through an appropriate legal framework, policies and structures.
Deliver improved patient outcomes
29. Delivering improved patient outcomes covers a range of areas.
Primary care services, encompassing team-based delivery by GPs and a wide range of other health professionals and provided in the communities where people live, can meet the great majority of people’s day-to-day healthcare needs.
The capacity and range of services in primary care must continue to be developed, as a cornerstone of the health system’s response to the pressures of a population that is ageing and at the same time, living with an increasing incidence of chronic disease.
Structured primary care services in the community, integrated with social care and mental health services, as well as the acute hospital system, have the greatest potential to contribute to the achievement of improved patient outcomes.
30. The National Clinical Programmes have greatly improved services in many specialised areas, such as stroke and cardiology.
It is important that they are very much at the centre of operational delivery and reform.
Therefore, it is planned to organise them into five integrated care programmes and embed them into the HSE Service Directorates.
Integrated care programmes are how we link the different areas of the health services (primary care, acute hospitals, social and continuing care) and how, within those settings, different areas can best link and work together to improve the patient experience.
31. An equally important aspect of delivering improved patient outcomes is enhancing patient safety, quality and clinical effectiveness.
It is of the utmost importance that patient safety remains an overriding priority across the health service.
We first set out our approach to patient safety and quality in Patient Safety First which is our ongoing commitment to create the momentum for positive change towards patient safety.
All health service staff, individually and collectively, will continue to have a responsibility for the quality of services they deliver to the patients and service users in their care.
It is important that they integrate a commitment to quality and safety into their core work and practice.
Priority areas that will continue to be the focus of attention include medication safety, healthcare associated infections and the implementation of the national early warning score.
We will extend the suite of National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) National Clinical Guidelines and establish the NCEC National Clinical Audit function.
This will promote the reduction of inappropriate variation in practice leading to improved patient safety.
32. We are committed to developing a social and continuing care system that maximises independence and achieves value for resources invested.
The groups for which most social care supports are provided currently are those people with disability, older people and those with mental health difficulties.
The common thread running through all of these groups is the need to provide a service which holds the individual care recipient at its centre.
We need to foster innovation and ensure services maximise independence and achieve value for money.
Such a system will enhance quality of care and give individuals much greater control over their own care.
33. Our strategic approach, based on international best practice, is to meet the needs of individuals in these care groups through an integrated system, subject to robust governance and accountability frameworks, quality assured and regulated.
For older people, we want to support them to live independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.
For people with disabilities, we want to support them to participate to their full potential in economic and social life.
We will continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and update the document itself over the course of this Strategy.
This includes the ongoing development and re-configuration of adult and child and adolescent mental health teams, along with other specialist mental health services.
34. Our specific deliverables in the priority area of improving patient outcomes are:
Agree priorities for the extension of HIQA’s regulatory remit, commencing with private healthcare providers.
Establish national healthcare quality reporting system, including publication of annual report
Extend the suite of NCEC national clinical guidance and audit
Develop and implement a public health plan for hepatitis C
Publish and implement a maternity care strategy
Publish and implement a cancer strategy
Strengthen indemnity arrangements with providers to enable improved quality and patient safety
Examine processes for addressing claims of clinical negligence in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality
Implement five integrated care programmes to introduce clinically-led, multidisciplinary integrated models of care in respect of:
Patient flow
Older people
Chronic disease prevention and management
Children’s health
Maternal health
In 2015, achieve a one third reduction in delayed discharges and in the average number of patients waiting for admission on trolleys in ED for over 9 hours (Q4 average number of delayed discharges and SDU TrolleyGAR) and reduce that further in later years
Specialty based waiting lists for each hospital to be made public by Summer 2015
Publish the national framework for suicide prevention
Implement the Emergency Department Taskforce Action Plan and review regularly to ensure optimal effect;
Review assessment of needs provision under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005
Progress the reconfiguration of adult day services, including the provision of appropriate services for young school leavers with disabilities who have continuing support needs
Progress the reconfiguration of residential services as recommended in Time to Move from Congregated Settings
Reconfigure services under the Progressing Disabilities Services Programme for Children and Young People 0-18
Publish the general scheme of a bill to regulate assisted human reproduction and stem cell research, with a view to introducing legislation to regulate this area for the first time.
Implement agreed steps towards universal healthcare
35. During the lifetime of this strategy, we will make the first concrete steps to Universal Healthcare in 2015, by extending GP services without fees to the under 6s and over 70s.
Therefore, by the end of 2015, almost half of the population (49%) will have access to GP services, without fees.
That will be a major step on the way to universal health care.
36. Over the lifetime of the Strategy, we will plan for the further extension of GP services without fees to more of the population.
We will put in place models of care that improve the way people can access services, by supporting new models of chronic disease management, increasing GP access to diagnostic services and progressing the provision of minor surgery.
We will also commence development of a revised contractual framework for the provision of publicly funded GP services as part of an integrated health service and agree a new GP contract over the period of this Strategy.
37. We will complete an initial costing analysis of the Universal Health Insurance proposals outlined in the White Paper then revert to Government with a roadmap for next steps.
We will oversee the authorisation process of the VHI by the Central Bank of Ireland as a regulated entity.
To promote a sustainable and affordable private health insurance market we will implement a package of measures to increase the number of people with private health insurance including the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating and Young Adult Rates.
Reform Operational Systems to drive high performance
38. In 2014, the HSE published its plans to establish community healthcare organisations (CHOs) to streamline the management and delivery of primary care, social care and mental health services.
The CHOs will facilitate the integrated delivery of care, in the communities where people live and in association with the acute hospitals so that care pathways are appropriately planned and needs are met in the right setting.
The nine CHOs will operate as part of the HSE and existing community services resources will be re-organised into 90 primary care networks, each headed by a person responsible for care delivery by professionals such as nurses, therapists and social workers.
39. The reorganisation of public hospitals into Hospital Groups is designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients.
The hospitals making up each group of will work together to provide acute care for patients and will work to develop close relationships with health and social care services in the community.
The objective is to maximise the amount of care delivered locally while ensuring that highly specialised and complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.
We will develop hospital groups and get them up and running, including approving a strategic plan for each group.
We will also develop and implement policy on national specialties.
We will enact legislation to merge the three children’s hospitals into one.
40. We will agree an action plan with the HSE to implement the recommendations of the ambulance service reviews and to develop and implement revised models of care for pre-hospital emergency care.
41. In reforming operational systems, we are conscious of the need to have excellent accountability frameworks throughout the health service.
The Department – and the HSE - will have more autonomy on staffing and human resources as the end of the moratorium on recruitment provides greater room to manage staffing levels.
The return of the Vote to the Department from 2015 is part of this improved accountability framework and will underline the importance of the Department in its monitoring of health spending.
42. Ensuring that we have the right people with the right skills in the right places at the right time is a critical success factor for delivering on our priority areas.
In this context, playing our part in nurturing a health system where high performance is achieved and the knowledge and skills of health service staff are enhanced and developed is key.
Our underlying objective here is to achieve a stable and sustainable workforce, aligned to the achievement of national priorities and clinical and operational improvement.
43. We will develop accountability frameworks for regulated health professionals, both in the context of overall accountability frameworks, but also in the context of enhancing patient safety and strengthening patient advocacy.
We will further strengthen professional regulation through our ongoing programme of modernising the legislation governing professional health regulators.
This will include transposing into Irish law the modernised EU Directive on Professional Qualifications together with the development and enactment of a new Dental Act.
44. In 2013, we enacted legislation (the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to implement generic substitution and reference pricing for drugs and medicines.
Generic substitution – where patients can buy generic medicines at a lower cost than their branded equivalent – has and will continue to generate savings for patients and taxpayers.
In early 2015, we envisage that, by value, 80% of the off-patent market will be subject to reference pricing.
Agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI) have also generated savings for patients and taxpayers.
Over the lifetime of this Strategy, we will secure further economies in State expenditure on drugs and medicines through generic substitution, reference pricing and other arrangements.
45. While we improve our operational systems to drive high performance now, we will also scope and analyse approaches to new health structures with a view to implementing necessary structural changes within an appropriate timeframe.
46. Our specific deliverables in the priority area of refining operational systems to drive high performance are:
Support the improvement of HSE income collection arrangements and the implementation of shared services and external service delivery plans.
Implement agreed HSE Performance Accountability Framework system and monitor implementation of the HSE corporate plan and annual service plans
Support the procurement and phased implementation of a new national financial management system in the HSE.
Implement a new appointment process for State boards in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service;
Develop a mechanism to ensure the implementation of HIQA recommendations made to the HSE
Develop and implement a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning;
Develop a sector wide Human Resources Framework and Forum designed to provide best practice advice and guidance to the Health sector create a nationally integrated workforce supply chain.
Enact legislation to merge the three children’s hospitals into one
Introduce innovative funding models
47. The Government remains committed to the introduction of the ‘Activity-Based Funding’ (ABF, also known as Money Follows the Patient) funding model whereby hospitals are paid for the actual work they do.
The funding model, which is a multi-year project, will drive efficiency and increase transparency in the provision of high quality hospital services and will continue to be implemented on a phased basis during and beyond the lifetime of this Strategy.
In 2014, ABF commenced its first phase in 38 hospitals in respect of inpatient and daycase activity.
Over the period of this Strategy, we will further embed ABF in the health services through overseeing the implementation of the HSE’s strategic framework and implementation plan for ABF.
In particular, we will work with the HSE to develop an outpatient classification system and carry out research into incentivised payment systems for community care.
48. The idea of commissioning for better outcomes is fundamental in using resources to drive improvement for patients and service users.
We will develop a policy framework on healthcare commissioning.
49. We’ll also examine the potential to use social impact bonds to finance better outcomes in addiction services and review the contribution of relevant tax reliefs to health policy objectives.
Modernise health facilities and ICT infrastructure
50. Data is a vital component of any modern enterprise and this is especially so for the health services.
The Health Identifiers Act 2014 provides the legislative framework for a national system of unique identifiers for patients and for health service providers for use across the health service, both public and private.
Individual health identifiers (IHIs) are designed to make sure that the right information is associated with the right patient at the point of care.
In addition, identifiers will help make our health service more efficient and will support health reform initiatives including Activity Based Funding.
Health identifiers are a fundamental building block in support of the eHealth agenda.
It is a complex issue which will require detailed planning across all our services so that we can provide adequate data protection and privacy for patients while also enabling valuable patient research and statistical data for professionals so that they can improve work practices and outcomes.
In the lifetime of this strategy, we will establish and implement the individual health identifier.
In 2015, the first identifiers will be issued to patients.
51. In 2014, we launched our ten year eHealth strategy and the HSE recently appointed a Chief Information Officer (CIO).
eHealth is our blueprint for better use of ICT to enhance patient safety, drive efficiencies and increase the quality of care.
We will increase investment in ICT and eHealth and establish eHealth Ireland.
52. We will publish and enact a Health Information Bill which will include measures designed to support the development of information systems and capacity, data quality and the eHealth agenda, promote an improved patient safety culture, encourage health research and strengthen patients’ rights in relation to their health information.
53. Suitable and appropriate facilities are required to support health care delivery.
Significant projects - large and small – have been delivered in recent years.
More have commenced or are in planning.
Through the lifetime of this Strategy, we will seek to ensure that all projects remain on schedule and are delivered on time.
Since March 2011, 42 primary care centres have been delivered – which is almost one each month.
There are about 30 underway – funded through PPPs or leases - and a further 50 locations where projects are at earlier stages of development.
54. The specific deliverables in this priority area are:
Secure planning permission and commence construction works for the new children’s hospital
Lodge a planning application with an Bord Pleanála and commence construction of the national maternity hospital;
Commence construction of the new national forensic mental health campus with a view to completion by end-2017   
Deliver 37 new primary care centres (9 in 2015) and continue to work with the private sector to deliver primary care centres using the operational lease mechanism Deliver radiation oncology units for Cork and Galway and refresh equipment at St Luke’s under the National Plan for Radiology Oncology Pursue alternative public/private options to provide new community nursing units
Develop the Department’s workforce and capability
55. For our own Department, we recognise the need to continue to adapt to change and develop our own workforce and capability.
As a Department, we want to contribute to fostering a unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service that inspires confidence and trust, as envisaged in the Civil Service Renewal Plan.
56. We want to enhance staff engagement, promote staff learning and development while securing and allocating our resources effectively.
In this context, we want to ensure our organisational structures are aligned with our priorities and we want to strengthen evidence-based decision making.
In short, we want our Department to be an employer of choice within the Civil Service and beyond.
We want to be a Government Department where people seek to work, where our staff feel appreciated and valued and where their contributions are recognised.
We will champion our commitment to equality and diversity, ensuring our procedures and culture foster inclusivity.
57. We want our employee actions to be directly aligned with our business goals and thus promoting a higher performance level, greater workforce stability and a continuing development of our knowledge, including through effective succession planning.
We want to employ improved business systems to manage common processes, like parliamentary questions, submissions and records management.
58. We are fully committed to the ongoing programme of change in the Civil Service which seeks to build capacity to respond to existing and future challenges and improve the performance of the Civil Service and its staff.
The Civil Service Renewal Plan provides the framework for renewing the Civil Service over the next three years.
The Plan outlines a vision for the Civil Service and practical changes that will create a more unified, professional, responsive and open and accountable Civil Service, providing a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.
Strong leadership and active participation in the implementation of this programme of change will be a key focus over the period.
We also recognise the role that public service agreements play in enabling modernisation of public service delivery.
We will continue to play our part in implementing these agreements.
59. The specific deliverables in this priority area of developing our Department’s workforce and capabilities are:
Implement a communications plan and refine internal communications methodology and tools
Develop and implement a Departmental workforce learning and development plan, with an initial focus on people management skills for managers, and review it every year
Strengthen our governance, business planning, project management and performance management processes

How do covid-19
Vaccines work?
December 2020
Vaccines work by preparing a person ’ s immune system (the body ’ s natural defences) to recognise and defend itself against a specific disease.
Building immunity
Most research on covid-19 vaccines involves generating responses to all or part of a protein that is unique to the virus that causes covid-19.
When a person receives the vaccine, it will trigger an immune response.
Most covid-19 vaccines require two doses to build immunity.
If the person is infected by the virus later on, the immune system recognises the virus.
The system is then prepared to attack the virus.
How do the vaccines bought by the european commission work?
Nucleic acid vaccines (mrna)
Biontech / pfizer | moderna | curevac
This type of vaccine contains part of the ‘ instructions ’ from the virus that causes covid-19.
This allows the body ’ s own cells to make a protein that is unique to the virus.
The person ’ s immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by covid-19.
Protein-based vaccines
Sanofi / gsk
This type of vaccine contains fragments of a protein that is unique to the virus.
These are enough for the person ’ s immune system to recognise that the unique protein should not be in the body and to respond by producing natural defences against infection by covid-19.
Viral vector vaccines
Astrazeneca ¦ johnson & johnson
This type of vaccine uses a different, harmless virus to deliver the ‘ instructions ’ from the virus that causes covid-19.
This allows the body ’ s own cells to make the protein unique to the covid-19 virus.
The person ’ s immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by covid-19.
If the vaccinated person is later exposed to the covid-19 virus, their natural defences are able to recognise the protein in covid-19.
The body ’ s defences are ready to kill the virus, and to prevent it from entering cells or spreading further.
More information on covid-19 vaccination
For more information about the vaccination programme in your country, see the ecdc vaccine scheduler and visit the official websites on vaccination of the countries of the european union and the european economic area.
Vaccines protect people and communities against deadly diseases.
They have eradicated smallpox, and virtually eliminated other diseases like polio.
Vaccination builds up a person ’ s defences to common diseases that they are exposed to
Being vaccinated prevents people from catching the disease in the vast majority of cases.
In some cases, a person can still get a disease after being vaccinated.
The symptoms, however, are milder and recovery is faster.
Some of the diseases that vaccines protect against
Hepatitis b
Human
Papillomavirus
Infection
(Hpv)
Influenza
Measles,
Mumps and
Rubella
Polio
Tetanus
Tuberculosis
Better for everyone
A vaccinated person is less likely to pass on an infectious disease to others. So, people who get vaccinated can help protect those who cannot be vaccinated themselves.
This includes babies, children, older people and people with weak immune systems such as cancer patients.
These groups benefit from others getting vaccinated, because the disease then cannot spread in the community.
Measles
Community
Immunity
A high number of vaccinations is required to help create this community immunity.
When a high number of people are vaccinated, chains of infections are stopped.
For example, according to the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) 95% of people need to vaccinate against measles to prevent further spread in the community.
5% not vaccinated
95% vaccinated
Reducing the burden on people
By helping keep more people healthy, vaccination helps reduce the social and psychological toll of illness on people and lessens the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.
This means that resources can go to fighting other diseases, such as cancer or alzheimer ’ s.
Smallpox
Thanks to vaccination, smallpox has been completely wiped out.
It was once a common disease that killed a third of people who contracted it.
The last case of naturally contracted smallpox was in 1977 and it was eradicated in 1980.
Polio is an infectious disease mostly contracted by children.
1 person in 200 develops incurable paralysis after infection.
A vaccine was developed in 1955 and widely introduced.
As of 2020, the only remaining cases of polio have been found in pakistan and afghanistan.
The measles virus was identified in 1954 and a vaccine was introduced in 1963.
Thanks to vaccination, between 2000 and 2018, global deaths from measles fell by 73%.
23 million deaths were prevented.
The americas have been measles-free since 2002.
However, outbreaks of measles still occur in several european countries because vaccination coverage is insufficient in certain areas.
Put an end to the covid-19 pandemic.
The european commission is building one of the broadest portfolios of different vaccines that are safe, effective and affordable.
The commission secured doses of six of the most promising vaccines so far.
More may come.
Some of these future vaccines are based on new technologies, so we can develop and produce them rapidly in the face of the emergency.
They are also based on different technologies, to improve our chances of finding effective ones rapidly.
Vaccines only go on the market after a thorough and rigorous evaluation to prove they are safe for all.
Once authorised, the vaccines are made available to eu countries at the same time and at the same conditions.
So far, the commission has secured up to 4.4 billion doses biontech / pfizer up to 2.4 moderna up to 460 million doses billion doses
Option to purchase 900 million doses
To be effective, most vaccines are likely to need two doses per person.
We have secured sufficient doses of vaccines for eu citizens.
Vaccination is voluntary.
Europe is investing in vaccines not only for europeans.
Eu countries may donate vaccine doses to vulnerable countries in the neighbourhood and beyond.
The european commission has granted marketing authorisations to the biontechpfizer, moderna, astrazeneca and johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccines based on positive scientific opinions by the european medicines agency.
The first european citizens were vaccinated at the end of december 2020, during the eu vaccination days.

Well from my point of view it is a little flu
Well madam from listening to your symptoms it sounds like you've got one of the flu viruses
You are probably having chest pain
Preliminary estimates of the prevalence of selected underlying health conditions among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 — united states, february 12 – march 28, 2020
On march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) a pandemic.
As of march 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed covid-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide.
Reports from china and italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions.
U.s. older adults, including those aged ≥ 65 years and particularly those aged ≥ 85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe covid-19 – associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among u.s. covid-19 patients have not yet been reported.
As of march 28, 2020, u.s. states and territories have reported 122,653 u.s. covid-19 cases to cdc, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported.
Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported.
The percentage of covid-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (icu) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without icu admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%).
The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.
These preliminary findings suggest that in the united states, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from covid-19 than are persons without these conditions.
Data from laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported to cdc from 50 states, four u.s. territories and affiliated islands, the district of columbia, and new york city with february 12 – march 28, 2020 onset dates were analyzed.
Cases among persons repatriated to the united states from wuhan, china, and the diamond princess cruise ship were excluded.
For cases with missing onset dates, date of onset was estimated by subtracting 4 days (median interval from symptom onset to specimen collection date among cases with known dates in these data) from the earliest specimen collection.
Public health departments reported cases to cdc using a standardized case report form that captures information (yes, no, or unknown) on the following conditions and potential risk factors: Chronic lung disease (inclusive of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [copd], and emphysema); diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; immunocompromised condition; neurologic disorder, neurodevelopmental, or intellectual disability; pregnancy; current smoking status; former smoking status; or other chronic disease.
Data reported to cdc are preliminary and can be updated by health departments over time; critical data elements might be missing at the time of initial report; thus, this analysis is descriptive, and no statistical comparisons could be made.
The percentages of patients of all ages with underlying health conditions who were not hospitalized, hospitalized without icu admission, and hospitalized with icu admission were calculated.
Percentages of hospitalizations with and without icu admission were estimated for persons aged ≥ 19 years with and without underlying health conditions.
This part of the analysis was limited to persons aged ≥ 19 years because of the small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying health conditions (n = 32).
To account for missing data among these preliminary reports, ranges were estimated with a lower bound including cases with both known and unknown status for hospitalization with and without icu admission as the denominator and an upper bound using only cases with known outcome status as the denominator.
Because of small sample size and missing data on underlying health conditions among covid-19 patients who died, case-fatality rates for persons with and without underlying conditions were not estimated.
As of march 28, 2020, a total of 122,653 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases (figure) and 2,112 deaths were reported to cdc.
Case report forms were submitted to cdc for 74,439 (60.7%) cases.
Data on presence or absence of underlying health conditions and other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections (i.e., smoking and pregnancy) were available for 7,162 (5.8%) patients (table 1).
Approximately one third of these patients (2,692, 37.6%), had at least one underlying condition or risk factor.
Diabetes mellitus (784, 10.9%), chronic lung disease (656, 9.2%), and cardiovascular disease (647, 9.0%) were the most frequently reported conditions among all cases.
Among 457 icu admissions and 1,037 non-icu hospitalizations, 358 (78%) and 732 (71%), respectively occurred among persons with one or more reported underlying health condition.
In contrast, 1,388 of 5,143 (27%) covid-19 patients who were not hospitalized were reported to have at least one underlying health condition.
Among patients aged ≥ 19 years, the percentage of non-icu hospitalizations was higher among those with underlying health conditions (27.3% – 29.8%) than among those without underlying health conditions (7.2% – 7.8%); the percentage of cases that resulted in an icu admission was also higher for those with underlying health conditions (13.3% – 14.5%) than those without these conditions (2.2% – 2.4%) (table 2).
Small numbers of covid-19 patients aged & lt; 19 years were reported to be hospitalized (48) or admitted to an icu (eight).
In contrast, 335 patients aged & lt; 19 years were not hospitalized and 1,342 had missing data on hospitalization.
Among all covid-19 patients with complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors, 184 deaths occurred (all among patients aged ≥ 19 years); 173 deaths (94%) were reported among patients with at least one underlying condition.
Among 122,653 u.s. covid-19 cases reported to cdc as of march 28, 2020, 7,162 (5.8%) patients had data available pertaining to underlying health conditions or potential risk factors; among these patients, higher percentages of patients with underlying conditions were admitted to the hospital and to an icu than patients without reported underlying conditions.
These results are consistent with findings from china and italy, which suggest that patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, copd, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher risk for severe disease or death from covid-19.
This analysis was limited by small numbers and missing data because of the burden placed on reporting health departments with rapidly rising case counts, and these findings might change as additional data become available.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with covid-19.
Many of these underlying health conditions are common in the united states: Based on self-reported 2018 data, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among u.s. adults was 10.1%, and the u.s. age-adjusted prevalence of all types of heart disease (excluding hypertension without other heart disease) was 10.6% in 2017.
The age-adjusted prevalence of copd among u.s. adults is 5.9%, and in 2018, the u.s. estimated prevalence of current asthma among persons of all ages was 7.9%.
Cdc continues to develop and update resources for persons with underlying health conditions to reduce the risk of acquiring covid-19.
The estimated higher prevalence of these conditions among those in this early group of u.s. covid-19 patients and the potentially higher risk for more severe disease from covid-19 associated with the presence of underlying conditions highlight the importance of covid-19 prevention in persons with underlying conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations.
First, these data are preliminary, and the analysis was limited by missing data related to the health department reporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review; these findings might change as additional data become available.
Information on underlying conditions was only available for 7,162 (5.8%) of 122,653 cases reported to cdc.
It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or underlying health conditions.
Second, these data are subject to bias in outcome ascertainment because of short follow-up time.
Some outcomes might be underestimated, and long-term outcomes cannot be assessed in this analysis.
Third, because of the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more widespread.
Fourth, because of the descriptive nature of these data, attack rates among persons with and without underlying health conditions could not be compared, and thus the risk difference of severe disease with covid-19 between these groups could not be estimated.
Fifth, no conclusions could be drawn about underlying conditions that were not included in the case report form or about different conditions that were reported in a single, umbrella category.
For example, asthma and copd were included in a chronic lung disease category.
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe covid-19 among persons in these groups.
Persons in the united states with underlying health conditions appear to be at higher risk for more severe covid-19, consistent with findings from other countries.
Persons with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of covid-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, should immediately contact their health care provider.
These persons should take steps to protect themselves from covid-19, through washing their hands; cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and social distancing, including staying at home, avoiding crowds, gatherings, and travel, and avoiding contact with persons who are ill.
Maintaining at least a 30-day supply of medication, a 2-week supply of food and other necessities, and knowledge of covid-19 symptoms are recommended for those with underlying health conditions.
All persons should take steps to protect themselves from covid-19 and to protect others.
All persons who are ill should stay home, except to get medical care; should not go to work; and should stay away from others.
This is especially important for those who work with persons with underlying conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from covid-19.
Community mitigation strategies, which aim to slow the spread of covid-19, are important to protect all persons from covid-19, especially persons with underlying health conditions and other persons at risk for severe covid-19 – associated disease (https: / / www.cdc.gov / coronavirus / 2019-ncov / downloads / community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).
What is already known about this topic?
Published reports from china and italy suggest that risk factors for severe covid-19 disease include underlying health conditions, but data describing underlying health conditions among u.s. covid-19 patients have not yet been reported.
What is added by this report?
Based on preliminary u.s. data, persons with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for severe covid-19 – associated disease than persons without these conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions, including social distancing and handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of covid-19.
Emergence of a novel coronavirus (covid-19): Protocol for extending surveillance used by the royal college of general practitioners research and surveillance centre and public health england
The royal college of general practitioners (rcgp) research and surveillance centre (rsc) and public health england (phe) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics.
With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (covid-19), a uk national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to covid-19.
At the same time and separately, the rcgp rsc ’ s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of covid-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
The aims of this study are to surveil covid-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of covid-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.
The rcgp rsc, a network of over 500 general practices in england, extract pseudonymized data weekly.
This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to covid-19.
Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.
(2) extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) — with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to covid-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.
(3) serology sample collection across all age groups.
This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.
The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.
(4) collecting convalescent serum samples.
We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.
Swabs and sera will be analyzed in phe reference laboratories.
General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support covid-19 surveillance.
Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for covid-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with lrtis.
Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.
We have rapidly converted the established national rcgp rsc influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the covid-19 containment policy.
The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.
Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.
The royal college of general practitioners (rcgp) research and surveillance centre (rsc) is a network of general practices (gps) with a nationally representative population that provides pseudonymized data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases.
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by public health england (phe) and covers 37 infectious diseases, including influenza.
The rcgp rsc and phe have an established collaboration of over 50 years in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and are now in their 53rd season of surveillance and analysis.
The rcgp rsc extracts pseudonymized data from a nationally representative sample of over 500 urban and nonurban gps each week covering a population of over 4 million.
Data from these practices are reported online in a weekly return, which includes monitoring weekly rates of influenza-like illness (ili) and other communicable and respiratory diseases in england.
We also produce an annual report.
The rcgp rsc data set includes all coded data and all prescribed items including vaccine exposure.
The rcgp rsc conducts virology surveillance each influenza season, with 100 gps participating in the 2019-2020 season (figure 1).
These virology sampling practices are also recruited to be nationally representative (figure 1).
Gps take nasopharyngeal swabs from persons showing acute respiratory illness within 7 days of the onset of symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from children younger than 5 years showing symptoms of acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis.
Additionally, nasopharyngeal samples are taken from anyone 5 years and older showing acute onset of ili and respiratory synctial virus.
Swabs are tested at the phe respiratory virus unit for influenza to monitor positivity rates and circulating strains, as well as for measuring vaccine effectiveness.
The rcgp rsc successfully conducted a pilot collecting serological samples from adults and linking them to a patient ’ s medical records during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
This pilot was in collaboration with the phe seroepidemiology unit and added to the residual blood samples submitted to phe by national health service (nhs) laboratories.
Serology can provide important information about background population immunity, and sentinel networks can provide a mechanism for systematic data collection and linkage to medical records and health outcomes.
The serology pilot has demonstrated the ability of the network to collect serology samples in adults.
With the covid-19 outbreak, phe and rcgp rsc have adapted existing influenza surveillance to monitor the spread of covid-19 in the community, and this protocol sets out the basis for that collaboration.
The primary national strategy for covid-19 infection is containment, with patients who are at high risk managed via the telephone help system nhs111 and the phe health protection teams, but the rcgp rsc surveillance is entirely separate.
The rcgp rsc, by extending its established work, will provide virological and serological surveillance to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of covid-19 infection in the community, and assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
We would not be working in isolation on this research.
We will share the protocol with uk colleagues and the i-move consortium who have recently obtained eu horizon 2020 funding from the stream “advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the novel coronavirus epidemic ”.
It is anticipated that great efficiencies in project management will result through this collaboration than that obtained from countries acting alone.
The aim of this study is to identify whether there is undetected community transmission of covid-19, estimate population susceptibility, and monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of covid-19 infection in the community.
The objectives of this study are as follows:
To monitor the burden of suspected covid-19 activity in the community through primary care surveillance and clinical coding of possible covid-19 cases referred into the containment pathway
To provide virological evidence on the presence and extent of undetected community transmission of covid-19 and monitor positivity rates among individuals presenting ili or acute respiratory tract infections to primary care
To estimate baseline susceptibility to covid-19 in the community and estimate both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposure rates in the population through seroprevalence monitoring
To pilot implementation of a scheme for collection of convalescent sera with antibody profiles among recovered cases of covid-19 discharged to the community
We intend to capture the following.
Clinical workload related to reports of covid-19 using the codes created to flag cases, those being assessed and where the infection is located are excluded (figures 2- ​ -44)
Foreign countries visited in the last 28 days
Existing codes that may have utility (tables 1- ​ -3) .3).
Many gps and primary care teams may not realize that important relevant data can be coded.
There is also the potential during any pandemic to monitor the effectiveness of any transmission control measures.
Reliable coding of letters and test results that will show an infection has become either confirmed or excluded
The methods will follow the approach used in the current influenza surveillance system and recent serology study, and includes five components: (1) primary care clinical surveillance; (2) virological surveillance; (3) population serological surveillance; (4) convalescent sera in cases; and (5) data curation.
The nhs uses the systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms (snomed ct) system of coding, which is normally only updated twice annually.
There was added complexity as some computerized medical record (cmr) suppliers use the read coding systems (read clinical terms version 3 – ctv3), which is no longer updated.
Additionally, there were no clinical codes to record covid-19 in early february 2020.
Therefore, the two main gp system suppliers added the five terms shown in table 4 as system-wide local codes.
A uk emergency release of snomed ct concepts for covid-19 was also subsequently made available across all cmr systems (table 4).
The intention is that these will eventually be mapped to the new snomed ct concepts as they become available, allowing recording of relevant data (multimedia appendix 1).
The key requirements for this release were the ability to code (table 4) a case of covid-19, exposure to risk of infection (travel to an area where there may be a higher risk), contact with anyone infected with covid-19, a report that a person had been tested for covid-19, and that the disease had been excluded (likely a negative test).
In addition, practices are now able to code any foreign travel undertaken, including the ability to record visits to multiple countries (implemented february 8, 2020).
Figures 2- ​ -44 show the emis web implementation.
Currently, virology samples for influenza surveillance are accompanied by a standard request form.
For covid-19, we will create a new request form that will record:
Date of onset of symptoms
Diagnosis of any of the following:
Acute bronchitis / bronchiolitis in those younger than five years
Lower respiratory tract infection (lrti)
History of fever (y / n); measured (y / n); if yes, level
Shortness of breath (y / n), if measured: Oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
Recent travel (y / n); if yes, countries visited in last 14 days
Contact with a named person with confirmed covid-19 (y / n) with a free text comment about the level of certainty
These codes will be grouped ontologically into “definite ”,“ probable ”, “possible ”, and“ not a case ” using our standard approach to grouping codes (table 5), which has been used previously across disease areas.
The rcgp rsc definition for ili is shown in multimedia appendix 2.
Public presentation of data using an observatory and dashboards
We will develop an observatory to present data nationally and a dashboard for feedback to practices about their data quality and collection of virology and serology samples.
This is based on coding described in table 4.
Definite case will be presented on our dashboard as “cases ” of covid-19.
Possible cases will be presented as “under investigation ” (investigating).
“not a case ” will be presented as“ excluded ”.
Online data has been established within the initial few weeks in the covid-19 observatory (figure 5), indicating the overall number of patients and rate per 10,000 patients of cases confirmed or under investigation, as well as where the virus is excluded.
We have the option to move to twice weekly surveillance reports with a scope to change this to daily reporting.
We will continue virology sampling from our sentinel practices, rather than discontinuing as seasonal influenza declines.
Additionally, we will recruit more surveillance practices.
The rcgp rsc virology practices will aim to undertake 200-300 nasopharyngeal swabs per week across the rcgp rsc sentinel network, collecting specimens across all age bands.
In addition to the inclusion criteria for influenza virology surveillance (ili, acute bronchitis / bronchiolitis), participating practices will take nasopharyngeal swab samples from any people showing acute symptoms of lrti if the onset of symptoms is within 7 days.
Rcgp rsc research officers and practice liaison staff will manage practices to achieve a total national sample of 200-300 swabs per week.
This could be increased if phe modelers require more samples.
Samples from each practice would be spread across the following age groups: & lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years and older
Samples (swabs or serum) collected will be sent via prepaid envelopes addressed to the appropriate phe laboratory for analysis.
All samples collected will be tested for the presence of influenza and covid-19.
Additionally, phe will retrospectively test any influenza virology samples collected between early and mid-february 2020 for covid-19.
Practices will still follow the phe protocol for covid-19 with respect to people at risk of infection who should be signposted down the containment pathway, rather than physically attend their practice.
Direct testing of those who attend surgery remains permitted, but we have also rolled out self-swabbing at home.
Summary of processes are detailed in multimedia appendix 3.
Everyone with an ili or a respiratory illness who contacts a gp (eg, phones for an appointment) should be asked specifically about recent travel to china and other countries flagged in current phe advice, or if they have had contact with other people with covid-19.
If these screening enquiries are positive, the patient would be advised to not come to the practice but instead to follow the phe flow sheet.
This can be by a reception or clinician staff, depending on individual practice protocol.
These calls should be coded into the gp cmr system and can be reported as part of the rcgp rsc weekly return.
We have developed training material to support this coding (multimedia appendix 4).
These include prompt cards for:
Practice reception or triage staff: For coding of any patients calling the practice with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with a history of travel to important areas based on phe advice
Administrative staff or clinicians who code: To encourage consistent coding of results for any suspected cases, including coding of negative results for exclusion
Practices participating in virology surveillance will opportunistically collect blood samples from patients coming into the practice for a routine blood test.
Patients who attend their practice for a routine blood test will be asked to provide an additional sample for serology.
We have conducted initial searches within the rcgp rsc database to look at the number of full blood count (fbc) results and overall rates in adults and children (figures 6- ​ -9) .9).
An fbc is one of the most common tests performed, and we hope this will give an approximate indication of overall numbers of blood tests performed.
The sampling rate, per 100,000 patients was highest for children 15-17 years of age and 60 year or older in adults, with the lowest rates in children 0-4 years of age and 18-29 years of age in adults (figures 6- ​ -99).
We will provide 1000 serology baseline samples across all ages that reflect the varying rates of attendance by age.
Additionally, we will test if we can obtain these all from virology practices to enhance the yield.
A good geographical spread is important, so phe can advise on areas where serology will most usefully be collected.
This will be followed by 800 samples monthly.
The sample will be stratified with 200 specimens for prepandemic survey (100 for monthly) in the following age groups: & lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older.
The younger patients, in many practices younger than 14 years, and in nearly all for children younger than 8 years will require pediatric serology surveillance.
We will develop a new request form for practices to capture recent travel and exposure to covid-19.
We will pilot a scheme for collecting convalescent serology from people with confirmed cases and who have had an acute virology sample at the time of their infection.
This is to identify a carrier state in patients who have recovered from the virus but may continue shedding the virus.
If there are a small number of cases, this may assist in developing a test kit for patients to take to their own gp and explore its acceptability to patients.
If there are a large number of covid-19 cases nationally, convalescent samples could be collected from rcgp rsc practices where there are confirmed cases, with the ability to link to the full medical record.
This process may include checking pseudonymized nhs numbers for positive individuals at rcgp rsc practices, checking current phe guidance regarding considerations of infectiousness for confirmed cases, and offering the patient an appointment following the previously mentioned process.
This needs to be carefully coordinated nationally across the network and may require phe to ensure individuals are not contacted by multiple agencies.
Rcgp rsc could provide a useful structure to channel the initial contact once phe has made a request.
The rcgp rsc practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of a lrti.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and covid-19.
The rcgp rsc will explore ways to collect convalescent samples from any patients tested positive for covid-19 through the extension of the virological surveillance.
From the start, we will be carefully curating data to ensure that it can be used for future studies.
Our clinical data will be linked to virology.
We will curate our data using the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable principles.
To facilitate this our data set is listed with health data research uk and the european health data evidence network.
The statistical methodology is in support of a policy approach to widespread disease outbreak, where so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions (npis) are used to respond to an emerging pandemic to produce disease suppression.
This policy aims to reduce contact rates in the population and thereby reduce transmission of the virus.
To implement this the uk government has recently articulated the desire to implement population self-isolation measures.
By targeting the reproduction number (r) (the average number of secondary cases each case generates) and aiming to reduce the r to below 1, the policy seeks to reduce case numbers to low levels or (as seen in previous outbreaks with severe acute respiratory syndrome and ebola) to eliminate human-to-human transmission.
As the experience from the 2009 h1n1 pandemic has shown, npis can be a crucial component of pandemic mitigation.
Key to the focus of our study will be the estimation of peak cases in the population and continual monitoring by data collection and modelling the potential growth and emergence of subsequent peaks in new cases as social distancing measures are relaxed.
There has already been publication of important disease epidemiological measures concerning the outbreak of covid-19 in mainland china.
A further fundamental measure in pandemic dynamics is the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness.
These factors, if estimated accurately, will give good predictions for the likely length of the pandemic, the final number of infected cases.
We intend to apply approximate bayesian inference (abc) to (possibly spatially heterogeneous) susceptible-exposed- infectious-removed (seir) stochastic epidemic models.
Such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease transmission modelling.
They are particularly suited to situations where likelihood functions are absent and where more traditional approaches such as markov chain monte carlo are impractical.
Such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the aspren surveillance data, a network of sentinel gps and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ilis and other conditions, where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed.
Furthermore, peaks in new cases have been estimated by distributional methods.
Estimates of the parameters of the seir model are tractable on large data sets because of parallelizability, and these methods have been implemented in several r libraries; we intend to use the libraries abseir (deposited on github: Https: / / tinyurl.com / vqu35cj) and abctools (https: / / tinyurl.com / tfjavz4) to estimate epidemic measures on a weekly basis.
Since we are fitting an sir-epidemic model in the abc routine, we anticipate that our results will be robust against weekly case data containing relatively small counts.
For example, see for the abc methodology applied to the tristan da cunha common cold data from 1967, where counts of i (number of infectious cases) and r (number of recovered cases) are in the tens at most.
Finally, in addition to the above methodology we will employ the kaplan-meier method with two outcomes (death and recovery) to estimate the case fatality ratio.
This approach is independent of the abc methodology and will allow comparisons between estimates from the two modelling approaches to judge robustness of results.
Rcgp rsc ’ s surveillance with phe is defined as health protection under regulation 3 of the health service (control of patient information) regulations 2002.
This has been confirmed by phe ’ s caldicott guardian ’ s office.
We do not see any increased risk to practices or practitioners taking part in this surveillance.
Infection prevention and control advice will follow extant national guidance.
Any cases identified will be managed according to the phe / nhs guidance in force at the time, including advice for identified contacts.
However, our training will include reminders about safe handling of specimens and revision of infection control measures anticipated to be high in our practices.
It is a key part of regulation 12 about safe care and treatment, periodically inspected by the care quality commission.
Travel history and clinical descriptors of the covid-19 infections
The rcgp rsc practices have been advised on the clinical coding that has been made available for covid-19 across all cmr systems.
This includes information on coding of clinical descriptors (table 4) and any recent travel history.
Establishment of extended virology sampling
The rcgp rsc practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of lrti.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and covid-19.
This has led to initial early identification of background spread in low-risk patients.
As of march 7, 2020, the surveillance system has detected 2 cases of covid-19 in low-risk patients with no history of travel through extended virological sampling.
This protocol describes how we have adapted a national influenza surveillance system to monitor community spread of an unexpected infection of covid-19.
We have rapidly created and incorporated new codes to allow data recording, and are collecting data to monitor the effectiveness of containment strategies.
Through this surveillance, we intend to find out more about the epidemiology of covid-19 in ambulatory care.
In particular, its rate of spread, both temporal and geographical.
Our testing of low-risk patients will also inform whether the containment strategy that is based on virology testing of high-risk patients and their contacts plus self-isolation is effective.
Containment should slow the spread, and there may be benefits in the management of spread from intense surveillance.
However, there may come a point at which the virus spreads more widely into the population, as has happened in italy.
Surveillance of low-risk patients should inform when we reach this tipping point and when infection rates start to remit.
The epidemiology of covid-19 remains emergent.
The registration-based nature of uk primary care means that we will be able to create a complete picture of the cumulative incidence and duration.
The surveillance system should be able to identify areas where covid-19 spread is taking place that might be suitable for trials of antiviral therapy.
We could also follow up on the effectiveness or any adverse reactions to these medicines or vaccinations.
Finally, early detection of a confirmed covid-19 case has exemplified the rapid implementation of this enhanced surveillance in the national network.
Safety of practices is our primary concern.
The rcgp rsc has operated for over 50 years and has been involved in collecting samples to monitor disease and vaccine effectiveness through the hong kong flu pandemic of 1968 / 69, the russian flu of 1977 / 78, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
We are not aware of any increased risk to practice staff or other patients from involvement in surveillance.
Pandemic preparedness is part of the role of the rcgp rsc.
It is plausible that enhanced coding of information from contacts with the practices in rcgp rsc will reduce the likelihood of people who may be suspected covid-19 cases being brought to the surgery inadvertently.
Where cases are detected unexpectedly, it is probably helpful for that patient, their contacts, and the practice to know.
The impact on practices has been to close for a day, if a case is found, for deep cleaning and then reopen.
The principal limitations of our system are the number of data points.
We are collecting serology and virology data from 100 sites, which covers a small group of the population.
This has been satisfactory for monitoring influenza, but we are not certain if this is a sufficiently large sample for the covid-19 outbreak.
Our sites (surveillance practices) are currently fixed, and it could be helpful to be able to rapidly onboard practices in regions where there are more cases.
Currently, we will be reporting weekly.
Our existing system can be enhanced to twice weekly, but maybe daily or hourly data should be our current approach.
Opportunistic sampling for serology in children younger than 10 years might be limited due to the overall reduced rate of blood tests in children.
The extended surveillance using the rcgp rsc-phe network for the emergent covid-19 outbreak has been established rapidly.
The model of getting the appropriate informatics to enable capture of the required data has already been a success, with data recording starting the week the codes were created.
In addition, modifying the existing surveillance system to collect population data in a parallel way has also been effective.
However, we are at present unsure as to whether the scale of this surveillance provides sufficient data to drive local containment strategies or if reporting infrequently meets the need of our information age.
National basketball association suspends season due to covid-19 concerns
On wednesday, the united states' national basketball association (nba) suspended its professional basketball season due to concerns regarding covid-19.
The nba's decision followed a utah jazz player testing positive for the covid-19 virus.
The nba did not release the identity of the player in question in its announcement.
They did say he was not present at chesapeake energy arena in oklahoma city, where the utah jazz were to play against the oklahoma city thunder.
According to its press release, the nba was "suspending game play following the conclusion of [wednesday's] schedule of games until further notice."
The jazz's game was cancelled, as was another nba game wednesday between the sacramento kings and the new orleans pelicans.
Other games scheduled for wednesday were still held, according to nbc news.
The united states' other major basketball organization, the national collegiate athletic association, which runs college basketball, has cancelled its own tournament, march madness, for both men's and women's leagues.
According to johns hopkins university, as of wednesday, there were at least 1,279 confirmed cases of covid-19 in the united states.
Cnbc reported there were at least 118,381 cases worldwide.
Us president trump declares covid-19 national emergency
On friday, united states president donald trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The move came two days after the world health organization declared the outbreak, which causes the covid-19 disease, to be a pandemic.
The move gives the federal government access to around us $50 billion in extra funding to combat the pandemic, according to nbc news.
The proclamation specifically said "the covid-19 outbreak in the united states constitutes a national emergency" and said the national emergency began on march 1, almost two weeks before the proclamation itself.
The united states department of health and human services declared the outbreak a "public health emergency" on january 31.
Trump did not place the federal emergency management agency (fema) in charge of the government's response to covid-19, which politico reported left some experts in disaster management disappointed.
Politico quoted tim manning, formerly a deputy administrator at fema, as saying "fema has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis" and "[i] f there's an emergency, fema needs to be involved."
Trump made the decision under provisions of the national emergencies act, amongst other governing authorities.
The trump administration also announced other efforts in response to covid-19, including waiving the interest it collects on federal student loans and increasing u.s. strategic oil reserve oil purchases.
Impact of the 2019 – 20 coronavirus pandemic on education
The 2019 – 20 coronavirus pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities.
As of 8 april 2020, approximately 1.716 billion learners have been affected due to school closures in response to covid-19.
According to unesco monitoring, 188 countries have implemented nationwide closures and 5 have implemented local closures, impacting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
On 23 march 2020, cambridge international examinations (cie) released a statement announcing the cancellation of cambridge igcse, cambridge o level, cambridge international as & amp; a level, cambridge aice diploma, and cambridge pre-u examinations for the may / june 2020 series across all countries.
International baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.school closures impact not only students, teachers, and families, but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.
School closures in response to covid-19 have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services.
The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.in response to school closures, unesco recommended the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.
Efforts to stem the spread of covid-19 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and preventive measures such as social-distancing and self-isolation have prompted the widespread closure of primary, secondary, and tertiary schooling in over 100 countries.previous outbreaks of infectious diseases have prompted widespread school closings around the world, with varying levels of effectiveness.
Mathematical modelling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools.
However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school.
School closures may be effective when enacted promptly.
If school closures occur late relative to an outbreak, they are less effective and may not have any impact at all.
Additionally, in some cases, the reopening of schools after a period of closure has resulted in increased infection rates.
As closures tend to occur concurrently with other interventions such as public gathering bans, it can be difficult to measure the specific impact of school closures.during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the united states, school closures and public gathering bans were associated with lower total mortality rates.
Cities that implemented such interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality rates.
Schools closed for a median duration of 4 weeks according to a study of 43 us cities' response to the spanish flu.
School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the asian flu by 90% during the 1957 – 58 outbreak, and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the us, 2004 – 2008.multiple countries successfully slowed the spread of infection through school closures during the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic.
School closures in the city of oita, japan, were found to have successfully decreased the number of infected students at the peak of infection; however closing schools was not found to have significantly decreased the total number of infected students.
Mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates.
Early school closures in the united states delayed the peak of the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic.
Despite the overall success of closing schools, a study of school closures in michigan found that "district level reactive school closures were ineffective." During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the uk, in an article titled "closure of schools during an influenza pandemic" published in the lancet infectious diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools in order to interrupt the course of the infection, slow further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine.
Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16.
They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in france during french school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened.
They noted that when teachers in israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999 – 2000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.
For schools and childcare facilities, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.
On 26 january, china instituted measures to contain the covid-19 outbreak which included extending the spring festival holiday to contain the outbreak.
Universities and schools around the country closed.
On 23 february, iran's ministry of health announced the closure of universities, higher educational institutions and schools in several cities and provinces.
On 3 march, unesco released the first global numbers on school closures and affected students.
It reported that 13 countries had enacted preventive measures including the temporary closure of schools and universities, impacting 290.5 million students around the world.
In reaction, unesco called on countries to support affected students and families and facilitate large-scale inclusive distance learning programmes.
On 4 march, the italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as italy reached 100 deaths.
In doing so, italy became one of 22 countries on three continents which had announced or implemented school closures.
On 5 march, the majority of learners affected by covid-19 emergency measures were located in china, with 233 million learners affected, followed by japan at 16.5 million and iran at 14.5 million.
By 10 march, one in five students worldwide was "staying away from school due to the covid-19 crisis" while another one in four was barred from higher education institutions.
On 13 march, governments in 49 countries announced or implemented school closures, including 39 countries which closed schools nationwide and 22 countries with localised school closures.
By 16 march, this figure increased from 49 to 73 countries according to unesco.
By 19 march, 50% of students worldwide were affected by school closures, corresponding to nationwide closures in 102 countries and local closures in 11 countries affecting 850 million children and youth.
By 20 march, over 70% of the world's learners were impacted by closures, with 124 country-wide school closures.
On 23 march, all nigerian school were found to have been closed down by nigerian government, markets as well as companies were closed down and children were forbidden by parents to step out of their homes.
On 26 march, all new zealand schools and universities have been closed down across the country.
The government has imposed a two-week holiday, allowing schools to transition to forms of distant teaching as soon as possible.
Universities have closed for one week, but resumed with online teaching afterwards.
Other school services remain open, but teaching is restricted to distant learning.
By 27 march, nearly 90 percent of the world's student population was out of class.
Regions with schools remaining open included taiwan, singapore, australia, sweden, and some u.s. states.
By 29 march, more than 1.5 billion children and other students were affected by nationwide school closures.
Others were disrupted by localized closures.
Until april 6, holidays were extended in all secondary schools of turkmenistan.
An order signed by the ministry of education as a preventative measure aims to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases in connection with the who coronavirus pandemic.
10 countries have localised schools closures, unesco estimates 473,933,356 learners are potentially at risk (pre-primary to upper-secondary education) and 77,938,904 learners are potentially at risk in tertiary education.
Note: Figures correspond to total number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [isced levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [isced levels 5 to 8] who could be affected should localised closures become countrywide.
Enrolment figures based on latest unesco institute of statistics data.
School closures in response to the covid-19 pandemic have shed a light on numerous issues affecting access to education, as well as broader socio-economic issues.
As of march 12, more than 370 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the spread of covid-19.
As of 29 march, nearly 90% of the world's learners were impacted by closures.even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs.
The disruptions they cause affect people across communities, but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work.
Working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children, incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity.
Localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open.
Women often represent a large share of health-care workers and often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures.
This means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a health crisis.
Lack of access to technology or fast, reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families.
Lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning, especially for students from disadvantaged families.
In response to school closures caused by covid-19, unesco recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.to aid in slowing the transmission of covid-19, hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed.
In the united states, numerous major cities announced public library closures, including los angeles, san francisco, seattle, and new york city, affecting 221 libraries.
For students without internet at home, this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning.
School closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school.
In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse.
Many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools.
When schools close, nutrition is compromised.nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children.in washington state, around 45% of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals.
At least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures.school lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the united states after food stamps.
Every year, nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast, lunch, snacks, and even dinner.in alabama, where state-wide school closures as of 18 march have affected over 720,000 students, the state superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches.
School closures negatively impact student learning outcomes.
Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close, children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development.
The disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school.student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends.
This is especially true of protracted closures.schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction.
When schools are closed, many children and youth miss out of on social contact that is essential to learning and development.when schools close parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task.
This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.
Potential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in federal acts of legislation at this time.
Formal education — as opposed to informal education or non-formal education — tends to refer to schools, colleges, universities and training institutions.
A 1974 report by the world bank defined formal education as the following: Formal education: The hierarchically structured, chronologically graded ‘ education system ’, running from primary school through the university and including, in addition to general academic studies, a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.the majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by covid-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems.
The unesco institute for statistics provides figures on students impacted by covid-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [isced levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [isced levels 5 to 8].
Early childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools, nursery schools, kindergartens, and some day care programmes.
While many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to covid-19, measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied.
In some countries and territories, preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.in the united states, the washington state department of children, youth, and families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open.
Some school districts may offer alternative child care options, prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers.
The governor of maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while washington state and california have left it to the discretion of care providers.
California governor gavin newsom explained his state's position, saying “we need our child care facilities, our daycare centers, to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures. ”
Colorado has encouraged the development of "tool kits" for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.in japan, prime minister shinzo abe closed all schools throughout the country until april 8, however, children's daycare facilities were excluded.
In early march, five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in kobe tested positive for coronavirus.
After testing over one hundred children at the facility, a preschool student was found to be carrying the virus.
Primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education.
The international baccalaureate organization (ibo) canceled the examinations for its diploma programme and career-related programme candidates scheduled between 30 april and 22 may 2020, reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide.
The ibo stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on "their coursework" and "the established assessment expertise, rigor, and quality control already built into the programme."
Tertiary education, also known as higher education, refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school.
Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training.
Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education, for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor's degree.
Students enrolled in higher education programmes at colleges, universities, and community colleges are often refereed to in countries such as united states as "college students." The closure of colleges and universities has widespread implications for students, faculty, administrators, and the institutions themselves.
Colleges and universities across the united states have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board.
In the united states of america, colleges and universities operate as "mini-cities" which generate significant revenue for cities, states, and regions.
For example, princeton university contributed $1.58 billion usd to the new jersey economy and students spent about $60 million in off-campus spending.
College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.according to linda bilmes of the harvard kennedy school, "local hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions...
These communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time. "Small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus.
In ithaca, new york, cornell university students spent at least $4 million a week in tompkins county.
In the wake of cornell's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction, the mayor of ithaca called for "immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of cornell university closing."
Unesco is sharing 10 recommendations during this period:
Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools: Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students.
This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, moocs, to broadcasting through radios and tvs.
Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes: Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices.
Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.
Protect data privacy and data security: Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals.
Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students ’ data privacy.
Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching: Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other.
Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.
Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes: Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students ’ knowledge of prior lessons.
Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents.
Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines.
Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.
Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools: Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed.
Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.
Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms: Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning.
Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.
Develop distance learning rules and monitor students ’ learning process: Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning.
Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students ’ learning process.
Try to use tools to support submission of students ’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students ’ feedback
Define the duration of distance learning units based on students ’ self-regulation skills: Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students ’ self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes.
Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students.
Create communities and enhance connection: Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.
290 million students out of school due to covid-19: Unesco releases first global numbers and mobilizes response, unesco.
Whereas on march 4, 2020, i proclaimed a state of emergency to exist in california as a result of the threat of covid-19;
And whereas in a short period of time, covid-19 has rapidly spread throughout california, necessitating updated and more stringent guidance from federal, state, and local public health officials;
And whereas for the preservation of public health and safety throughout the entire state of california, i find it necessary for all californians to heed the state public health directives from the department of public health.
Now, therefore, i, gavin newsom, governor of the state of california, in accordance with the authority vested in me by the state constitution and statutes of the state of california, and in particular, government code sections 8567, 8627, and 8665 do hereby issue the following order to become effective immediately:
It is hereby ordered that:
1) to preserve the public health and safety, and to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and prioritizing those at the highest risk and vulnerability, all residents are directed to immediately heed the current state public health directives, which i ordered the department of public health to develop for the current statewide status of covid-19.
Those directives are consistent with the march 19, 2020, memorandum on identification of essential critical infrastructure workers during covid-19 response, found at: Https: / / covid19.ca.gov /.
Order of the state public health officer
To protect public health, i as state public health officer and director of the california department of public health order all individuals living in the state of california to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined at https: / / www.cisa.gov / critical-infrastructure-sectors.
In addition, and in consultation with the director of the governor's office of emergency services, i may designate additional sectors as critical in order to protect the health and well-being of all californians.
Pursuant to the authority under the health and safety code 120125, 120140, 131080, 120130 (c), 120135, 120145, 120175 and 120150, this order is to go into effect immediately and shall stay in effect until further notice.
The federal government has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the united states that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination thereof.
I order that californians working in these 16 critical infrastructure sectors may continue their work because of the importance of these sectors to californians' health and well-being.
This order is being issued to protect the public health of californians.
The california department of public health looks to establish consistency across the state in order to ensure that we mitigate the impact of covid-19.
Our goal is simple, we want to bend the curve, and disrupt the spread of the virus.
The supply chain must continue, and californians must have access to such necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care.
When people need to leave their homes or places of residence, whether to obtain or perform the functions above, or to otherwise facilitate authorized necessary activities, they should at all times practice social distancing.
2) the healthcare delivery system shall prioritize services to serving those who are the sickest and shall prioritize resources, including personal protective equipment, for the providers providing direct care to them.
3) the office of emergency services is directed to take necessary steps to ensure compliance with this order.
4) this order shall be enforceable pursuant to california law, including, but not limited to, government code section 8665.
It is further ordered that as soon as hereafter possible, this order be filed in the office of the secretary of state and that widespread publicity and notice be given of this order.
This order is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the state of california, its agencies, departments, entities, officers, employees, or any other person.
In witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the great seal of the state of california to be affixed this 19th day of march 2020.
The sars-cov-2 virus is the cause of covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), a contagious respiratory disease that was first identified in december 2019, in wuhan, hubei, china.
The disease is a type of coronavirus, the same family that includes sars, mers, and some varieties of the common cold.
It was declared a pandemic by the world health organization (who) on 11 march 2020.
While much about covid-19 is still unknown, preliminary data suggests that it is more virulent and contagious than the seasonal flu, and less virulent but more contagious than sars and mers.
Older people and those with underlying conditions are the most at risk of serious complications including death.
Due to the spread of the disease, you are advised not to travel unless necessary, to avoid being infected, quarantined, or stranded by changing restrictions and cancelled flights.
Avoid crowded places whenever possible.
This is not just to protect you, but also those you come in contact with.
As it happens, you probably aren't missing much by staying home, as many attractions around the world are closing their doors to avoid spreading the disease.
If you do need to travel, take precautions as you would for other infections: Wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and avoid contact with sick people.
Before traveling, read up on the extensive and fast-changing array of travel restrictions that have been imposed around the world.
After travel, monitor your health and consider self-isolation for two weeks to avoid transmitting the disease to others.
Transportation from long-distance passenger flights to local buses has been curtailed or completely shut down in many countries due to low demand or government orders.
Many international and regional borders are closed.
If you are away from home, and especially if you are in another country, consider returning home as soon as possible; this may get even more difficult as restrictions continue to change.
In some cases it may simply not be possible, even if you're healthy and meet the legal requirements for entry.
If you can't find a way back to your country, contact your nearest embassy or consulate for assistance.
They may be able to organize an evacuation, identify non-regularly scheduled flights, or give you an emergency loan to pay for transport.
In case they can't, make preparations in case you need to stay where you are for an extended period.
If you do find a way back home, be prepared that it may be expensive, inconvenient, and have unusual restrictions (such as no checked baggage).
As of early april 2020, the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 is approaching one million.
Though the disease started in mainland china, it has spread around the world and china has fewer confirmed cases and deaths than several other countries.
Europe is the new epicenter of the pandemic.
All but a handful of countries have reported at least one case, with the highest numbers of reported cases in the united states, spain, italy, germany, france, mainland china, iran, and the united kingdom.
Local transmission is established in many countries in all major inhabited regions of the world except some pacific island nations.
(See updates from the who.)
The full extent of the spread is uncertain, due in part to limited testing.
Many countries are experiencing a severe shortage of test kits, and the authorities have not been able to test everybody who is at high risk, so the real number of cases is probably much higher than the official one.
Countries also differ in their testing and reporting practices, so comparisons of the number of reported cases do not tell the full story of how the epidemic has progressed in different areas.
The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and through objects.
The coronavirus is a relatively large virus, meaning it is not truly airborne: It will settle down in respiratory droplets.
Staying two metres (six feet) away from other people is usually enough to prevent transmission through this route.
Transmission from objects can happen, for example, if someone sneezes, touches a doorknob, and then other people touch the doorknob and then touch their faces.
The sars-cov-2 virus may last on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on plastic for up to 3 days.
Transmission via the fecal – oral route may also be possible.
Evidence suggests that covid-19 is contagious even without symptoms, though to what extent is still being investigated.
Common symptoms include a fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
Other less common symptoms include shortness of breath, a sore throat, headache, muscle pain, or sputum production.
Some patients have very mild symptoms, similar to a cold.
Serious complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure leading to disability or death.
About 80% of infections result in mild symptoms, while the remaining may result in hospitalization.
Case fatality rate is estimated at 1-3% of infected individuals, most of whom are elderly with underlying health conditions.
The fatality rate is much higher for those over 70 but significantly lower for those under 40.
Those most at risk of covid-19 infection and serious complications are the elderly and those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.
Not many cases are reported in children and most of these are mild or moderate, though a significant fraction do get pneumonia.
Occupationally, health care workers have higher risk compared to others with clusters of disease among workers and in health care settings.
The time between being exposed to the virus and the emergence of symptoms (incubation period) is typically between 2 and 14 days, though there has been one reported case in china where symptoms appeared 27 days after exposure.
As of february 2020, the period of infectiousness is unknown, but is likely most significant when people are symptomatic.
There is evidence of transmission from people who don't have symptoms, although to what extent is still being investigated.
It is unclear whether it is possible to be reinfected with the virus after recovering from it the first time around.
Long-term effects for people who have recovered remain unclear, but there is evidence of reduced lung capacity in some recovered patients.
Testing for the virus usually consists of a swab inserted through the nose or a throat swab which is analysed in a laboratory for the virus.
The current "gold standard" test involves extracting the genetic material from the sample and analysing it for known genetic markers of the virus.
There is no established test assessing for the virus or antibodies in the blood, although tests are being developed.
There is no test to establish immunity to the virus.
Many governments around the world have advised their citizens not to travel unnecessarily amid the pandemic.
Lots of airlines and package holidays are making it easy for you by waiving cancellation and change fees.
Particularly avoid cruise ship travel.
Older travelers and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk and should avoid travel that puts them at risk, such as long plane flights, visits to crowded places, and especially cruises, even outside of severely affected areas.
In affected areas, most experts recommend a practice known as social distancing.
This means minimising contact with others by keeping a distance of six feet or two meters from them and avoiding gathering together in groups.
Some areas permit small groups; others prohibit all group gatherings.
Measures you are encouraged to take include working from home whenever possible, avoiding crowds and avoiding leaving your home unless absolutely necessary.
If you must go out, try to stay at least 2 meters (6 feet) away from other people.
In many places these measures are required.
Follow hygiene practices like for flu prevention.
Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, and then dry your hands on a clean towel.
As coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, washing your hands with soap kills the virus by disrupting the mostly fat-based viral envelope.
Effective hand washing requires rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Drying your washed hands physically removes some germs from your skin (so don't skip that step, and don't share towels).
If soap and water are not available, then use a & gt; 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Alcohol is a quick germ-killer, but it's not quite instant, so this still requires the same 20 seconds of rubbing your hands together, making sure that every single scrap of skin gets wet, and then you have to wait about another minute, for the alcohol to completely dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands.
Most people touch their faces every few minutes, all day long.
Try to do this less, and try to wash your hands before touching your face.
Also, try to avoid touching surfaces you don't have to touch in the first place, at least with your bare hands.
Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and then immediately throw away the tissue and wash your hands.
Don't stand or sit near people who might be sick.
Stay at least one meter – and ideally two meters (six feet) – away.
As a quick way to eyeball this distance, imagine that you and the other person both reached your hands towards each other.
Could you touch the other person's hand without taking a step towards that person?
If the answer is yes, then you're too close.
Clean objects and surfaces that a lot of people touch, such as doorknobs, phones, and television remotes with regular household cleaner.
Disinfect the surfaces with a suitable disinfectant, such as diluted household bleach.
Stay home when you are sick, and avoid contact with other people until your symptoms are gone.
Do not share personal items that come into contact with saliva, such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, drinks, water bottles, and towels.
The practice of serving yourself from a common plate with your own chopsticks, common in china, should be avoided.
Greet people without touching them.
Avoid hugs, kisses, handshakes, fist bumps, and any other contact.
If it's impossible to avoid contact, then wash your hands both before and after.
It won't protect you from the coronavirus, but it will partially protect you from the flu, which remains a greater risk than covid-19 in many areas.
This also saves you from unnecessary worry if you get the flu and think it might be the coronavirus.
If you are elderly or otherwise in a high-risk group and can be vaccinated for pneumonia, get that vaccination.
It won't protect you from viral pneumonia from covid-19, but some covid-19 patients have died of bacterial pneumonia that attacked their weakened lungs, so a pneumonia vaccination could save your life.
Wearing masks is recommended for those who are suspected of carrying of disease and those who are in close contact with those infected.
For those who are asymptomatic, the who does not recommend masks, though some national governments do.
Wearing a mask of some kind is required in some countries and cities in an effort to reduce community transmission.
There are worldwide shortages of surgical masks.
If you do wear a mask, make sure to use it correctly.
The mask should cover your nose and mouth and fit without gaps.
Wash your hands before putting on the mask and avoid touching the mask while wearing it.
If you do touch it, wash your hands immediately afterwards.
When the mask becomes damp, discard and replace it.
Remove it from the back, throw it away, and then wash your hands.
Remember that masks are not a substitute for good hygiene: Continue to wash your hands frequently.
Don't stock up on masks if you don't need them.
Mask shortages mean that healthcare workers are having trouble getting a hold of masks, which puts everyone at risk.
That includes n95 respirators, which are not recommended for the general public – these are specialist equipment which must be fitted to be optimally effective.
Leave them for healthcare workers.
Avoid crowded areas, especially enclosed areas without much air circulation, such as conferences, performances, shopping malls, public transportation, and religious services.
Events which involve a large scale gathering of people, from religious pilgrimages to music concerts, are being canceled worldwide, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
Tourist attractions, businesses, and transportation may be closed, especially in affected countries.
Some canceled events, especially performances, sporting events, and classes, are being moved online, which means you can experience them without traveling.
At petrol / gas stations, use gloves or wipe down the handle with a disinfectant wipe if you can.
After filling up, clean your hands with hand sanitizer.
The u.s. and canadian governments recommend avoiding travel by cruise ship.
Infections spread easily on board, and medical care is limited.
Amid a cruise ship outbreak, quarantines and docking are challenging partly due to the large number of people aboard.
Even cruise ships without confirmed cases have been denied permission to dock due to virus fears, and in the high-profile case of the diamond princess in japan, hundreds of people were infected on the ship.
If you believe you may be infected, call a hospital or local emergency medical services instead of going in person to avoid infecting others.
Mention your symptoms and travel history.
Wear a medical mask and follow the instructions of authorities and doctors.
See also: Flight and health
On a plane, follow the same hygiene practices as anywhere else: Wash hands frequently, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if it's not convenient to leave your seat, and avoid touching your face.
Researchers have found that passengers in window seats have less risk of contact with sick people.
Try to book a window seat, and avoid moving around the cabin during the flight.
After washing your hands and before sitting down, use disinfectant wipes to wipe down the area around your seat.
Wipe hard surfaces, and if your seat is leather you can wipe that too.
Don't wipe a cloth seat, as the moisture can make transmission easier.
When using disinfectant wipes, follow the instructions on the packaging.
And remember, viruses enter through your mouth, nose, and eyes – wiping down the area doesn't hurt, but it's not a substitute for proper hygiene.
Wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
And use a tissue to touch the touch screen or other controls.
When using the lavatory, use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open the door, then throw them away.
Airlines in affected areas are taking steps to reduce transmission and keep passengers safe.
For instance, these may include cleaning facilities more frequently, allowing flight attendants to wear masks, and serving prepackaged instead of freshly heated meals.
If a group of passengers is connecting from an area with a severe outbreak, the flight attendants may be able to seat them away from the rest of the passengers (and if you were recently in a high-risk area, consider telling the flight attendants for this reason).
You may be prohibited from changing seats on the flight.
This is so that, if someone on the flight turns out to be infected, the authorities can track down the people who were sitting near them for testing or quarantine.
Covid-19 is treated by relieving symptoms and preventing complications.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the novel coronavirus.
Research into a vaccine or specific antiviral drug is underway.
There are a variety of trials using hiv medications and other novel antiviral medications for treatment of covid-19.
Mild symptoms may be relieved by taking paracetamol (acetaminophen).
If you are infected with covid-19, countries will isolate you until several consecutive tests for covid-19 are negative.
If you have been in close contact with someone infected with covid-19, many countries will quarantine you for 14 days since the last exposure and monitor you for signs and symptoms.
Some countries will also test you even if you don't have symptoms.
In many countries, the healthcare system has been stretched to the point of not being able to handle the sheer number of patients, and there is a chance you may be refused treatment due to the lack of available medical staff, supplies or equipment.
Many countries have shut down or severely limited flights, ships, and border crossings, especially to and from affected areas.
Even more countries have imposed restrictions on arriving travelers, either barring entry (maybe with an exception for local citizens and permanent residents) or requiring you to be quarantined, typically for 14 days.
Even if a mandatory quarantine is not imposed, you may be asked to "self-quarantine" by staying at home and not interacting with other people.
The most severe restrictions are on travellers who have recently been to affected areas, but increasingly many countries are applying them to incoming travellers overall.
Some countries have even prohibited all or almost all foreigners from entry or limited the ability of local citizens and residents to leave.
What are the affected areas?
Well, this is a fast-changing situation, and each country / region / organization has its own list of what areas are subject to restrictions.
The city of wuhan is on every list and the rest of mainland china is on most.
Other areas that are often included: France, germany, hong kong, iran, italy, japan, macau, singapore, south korea, spain, taiwan, the united kingdom, the united states, the schengen area as a whole, and sometimes various others.
Some countries have imposed restrictions based on citizenship or residency from severely affected areas.
A detailed list of entry restrictions is maintained by the iata.
It doesn't cover all the restrictions, but it's still useful.
Keep up to date — the outbreak and the travel restrictions are changing rapidly.
For travel in the near future, consider making refundable reservations in case the changing situation forces you to change your plans.
Avoid buying tickets with a connection in an affected area – even changing planes can make you subject to restrictions.
Flights may get canceled with little notice, either due to the disease's spread and ever-changing entry restrictions, or simply because fewer people are flying and airlines are having trouble filling seats.
You might also be delayed for hours upon arrival waiting for temperature checks and related procedures and paperwork, or even get quarantined for two weeks.
Be prepared for the possibility of disruption to your travel plans, especially if traveling internationally.
Even if you're nowhere near affected areas there's a risk that you'll have to stay at the destination longer than planned if you've shared a building or vessel with an infected person.
For example, in late february an italian doctor on vacation in costa adeje (canary islands) was diagnosed with covid-19, and as a result all the guests in the hotel he stayed at were quarantined.
Lockdowns and other internal restrictions
Some countries and regions, especially severely affected ones, are implementing emergency lockdowns and restrictions on people's movements and activities, even for those who haven't recently been abroad.
These include the temporary reintroduction of some border controls, restrictions on travel within the country, closing or limiting service at restaurants and other establishments, banning large public events, and in the most severe cases prohibiting people from leaving the house except for essential reasons.
Beyond government restrictions, individual establishments are shutting their doors and cancelling events to try to reduce the spread of the virus.
In china, there are extensive restrictions on transportation and activity, which vary widely by province, city, and even by district or village.
Many governments recommend against traveling to china at this time.
If you have no choice, do your research and get up-to-date information about the local situation wherever you are going.
People who have traveled to hubei face particularly severe restrictions.
Examples of restrictions that you may encounter in some parts of china (this is not an exhaustive list):
14-day quarantine, self-quarantine, or covid-19 test upon arrival from other parts of china or from other countries, at your expense
Questions about your travel and medical history (lying can get you years in prison)
Mandatory registration using an online or paper form
Requirement to wear a face mask in public
People who have been outside of china within 14 days not allowed into public places like malls
Shops only accept mobile payments, not cash
Restaurants, transportation and other establishments refusing service to non-chinese citizens
Many forms of transportation reduced or shut down
Mandatory real-name registration for public transit cards
Access in and out of a town, village, or city completely blocked
Non-resident visitors prohibited from entering apartment complexes
Only allowed to go outside once every two days to get supplies
Businesses, activities, and attractions closed
Businesses need local government permission to re-open
Restaurants (if they are even open) require a minimum distance between customers
Selling substandard face masks has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
As of mid-march 2020, europe is the epicenter of the epidemic, and many european countries have closed their borders to international travel - only border commuters and freight are allowed to cross.
Also businesses other than food stores and pharmacies are closed, and public transport has been reduced or stopped.
In the worst affected countries including italy, spain and france, lockdowns like in china in january, have been implemented.
As well the eu has closed its outer borders.
Covid-19 is prevalent also in north america.
The borders between canada, the u.s., and mexico are closed to non-essential travel, and in many areas bans on big gatherings are in effect (this means places like restaurants are closed, and events are canceled).
Numerous state, county, and municipal jurisdictions have issued stay-at-home orders that require all nonessential businesses to close.
With lots of flights canceled, warnings issued, and restrictions imposed, flying in the time of coronavirus can be a challenge.
Some routes are not possible.
Others will require more inconvenient connections than usual — multiple stops and long waits between flights.
In some cases that means more expensive tickets.
On the other hand, the good news is that many flights are cheaper than usual due to decreased demand, and there's a decent chance you'll get an empty seat next to you.
Build in extra time for your connections, especially if transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight and especially if your itinerary involves a country that's seriously affected.
Screenings, temperature checks, extra paperwork, and the associated waiting around can add minutes or hours before you're allowed to continue on your journey.
You may find it harder than usual to buy a ticket to or from a destination subject to warnings and restrictions.
This is a real concern if you're trying to get out of an affected area.
For instance, most aggregators are not selling tickets from china to the united states (presumably to avoid falling afoul of restrictions and being on the hook for a passenger's flight out).
To buy a ticket for an itinerary like this, you may have to contact the airline or use a lesser-known aggregator.
Another possibility is to buy two separate tickets (for instance, a ticket from china to cambodia and a second ticket from cambodia to the u.s.), but be careful you won't get quarantined or lose your luggage in between.
Connecting flights can be a problem.
The risk of getting stuck in the connection city is higher than usual right now, due to delays for screening and testing as well as extensive cancellations.
Connecting in an affected area may lead to entry restrictions later on, and if you've been in an affected area recently some countries won't even let you change planes.
On certain itineraries there is a risk of getting quarantined somewhere along the way.
So book a direct flight if you can, and if not, think carefully about where to connect.
In uncertain times, plans can change.
Many embassies and consulates have evacuated nonessential staff, and some have shut down operations completely.
Emergency assistance should still be available, though it's possible you may have to contact a further-away consulate if your local one has shut down.
If you have been stranded due to the pandemic, your nearest consulate may be able to help you find a flight home, arrange an emergency loan so you can buy a ticket, or provide an emergency passport.
At the very least they can keep you informed about the local situation and notify you about recently introduced travel requirements and restrictions.
Ordinary consular services such as visa and passport processing may be suspended or restricted to urgent need, depending on the location and the consulate.
Although some people call the disease "wuhan pneumonia" (武汉 (漢) 肺炎 / 武肺), "wuhan disease", or "chinese virus", the use of these terms is considered racist in china and by many people of chinese origin.
It is still common to refer the disease as "wuhan pneumonia" or "chinese virus" in places like hong kong and taiwan.
To be safe, use location-neutral terms when referring to the disease, such as "covid-19", "novel coronavirus", or just "the virus" or "the pandemic".
Particularly in developing countries where law enforcement are poorly trained, enforcement of curfew, lockdown or stay-at-home orders are often brutal, often using forces not proportionate against crowds.
Comply with these orders, and avoid crowds in public.
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, xenophobia has risen in many countries, primarily but not exclusively targeting people perceived to be chinese.
There has been a worldwide spike in racist incidents targeting people of east asian origin, including in major cities such as new york, london and san francisco.
In hong kong, sinophobia, which was already high to begin with, has intensified as a result of the pandemic, with the result that many shops and restaurants are now denying service to mainland chinese customers and banning mandarin speakers from their premises (with the exception of taiwanese).
Levels of xenophobia have also risen in east asia, with some restaurants and other businesses in japan and china refusing service to foreign customers.
In china, there have been incidents of foreigners being refused rooms by hotel staff, and foreign residents, particularly black people, being kicked out of their apartments on short notice by their landlords.

A variety of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus are being promoted online and even by some government officials, so be careful which sources you check for information.
Ensure that all information and advice you receive has been backed by reputable doctors and scientists.
In a crisis, it's natural to want to keep following the latest updates, but it may be better for your mental health to moderate the amount of news that you look at, and stick to reliable news sources.
If you normally watch the news twice per day then stick to this schedule and do something else, rather than having the 24-hour news on continuously.
B'bat sars-like coronavirus wiv1 (bat sl-cov-wiv1), also sometimes called sars-like coronavirus wiv1, is a strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sarsr-cov) isolated from chinese rufous horseshoe bats (rhinolophus sinicus).
Like all coronaviruses, virions consist of single-stranded positive-sense rna enclosed within an envelope.
The discovery confirms that bats are the natural reservoir of sars-cov.
Phylogenetic analysis shows the possibility of direct transmission of sars from bats to humans without the intermediary chinese civets, as previously believed.
B'covid-19 drug development is the research process to develop a preventative vaccine or therapeutic prescription drug that would alleviate the severity of 2019-20 coronavirus disease (covid-19).
The international clinical trials registry platform of the who recorded 536 clinical studies to develop post-infection therapies for covid-19 infections, with numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections under clinical research to be repurposed.
In march, the who initiated the "solidarity trial" in 10 countries, enrolling thousands of people infected with covid-19 to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
A dynamic, systematic review was established in april 2020 to track the progress of registered clinical trials for covid-19 vaccine and therapeutic drug candidates.vaccine and drug development is a multistep process, typically requiring more than five years to assure safety and efficacy of the new compound.
Drug development is the process of bringing a new infectious disease vaccine or therapeutic drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery.
It includes laboratory research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the fda, for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.
Development of a covid-19 vaccine or therapeutic antiviral drug begins with matching a chemical concept to the potential prophylactic mechanism of the future vaccine or antiviral activity in vivo.
New chemical entities (nces, also known as new molecular entities or nmes) are compounds that emerge from the process of drug discovery to specify a vaccine or antiviral candidate.
These have promising activity against a biological target related to covid-19 disease.
At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of the nce in humans.
It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy.
A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial ("first-in-human" [fih] or first human dose [fhd], previously also known as "first-in-man" [fim]).
In addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the nce: Its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.
Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a medicinal chemist producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and ton scale.
They further examine the product for suitability to package as capsules, tablets, aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or intravenous formulations.
Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as chemistry, manufacturing, and control (cmc) .many aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the regulatory requirements of drug licensing authorities.
These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.
The canadian government announced ca $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against covid-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at canadian universities, with plans to establish a "vaccine bank" of new vaccines for implementation if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
Clinical trial programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:
Phase i trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.
Phase ii trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the nce.
Phase iii trials are large, pivotal trials to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the covid-19 infection.
If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the nce advances to the new drug application (nda) stage to begin marketing.
Phase iv trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the fda, also called post-market surveillance studies.
In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).
In the united states, this process is called a "new drug application" or nda.
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an "adaptive design" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.
The global solidarity and european discovery trials of hospitalized people with severe covid-19 infection apply adaptive design to rapidly alter trial parameters as results from the four experimental therapeutic strategies emerge.
Adaptive designs within ongoing phase ii-iii clinical trials on candidate therapeutics may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, and coordinating design changes for a specific trial across its international locations.
Most novel drug candidates (nces) fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not prove efficacy on the targeted disease, as shown in phase ii-iii clinical trials.
The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as an "attrition rate", requiring decisions during the early stages of drug development to "kill" projects early to avoid costly failures.
One 2010 study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about us $1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.
A median cost estimate of 2015-16 trials for development of 10 anti-cancer drugs was $648 million.
In a 2016 review of 106 drug candidates assessed through clinical trials, the total capital expenditure for a manufacturer having a drug approved through successful phase iii trials was $2.6 billion (in 2013 dollars), an amount increasing at an annual rate of 8.5%.
Seven trials were evaluating repurposed drugs already approved to treat malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the chinese research, with 9 phase iii trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of april.
Led by the bill and melinda gates foundation with partners investing us $125 million and coordinating with the world health organization, the covid-19 therapeutics accelerator began in march, facilitating drug development researchers to rapidly identify, assess, develop, and scale up potential treatments.
The covid-19 clinical research coalition formed to coordinate and expedite results from international clinical trials on the most promising post-infection treatments.
In early 2020, numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections were being repurposed or developed in new clinical research efforts to alleviate the illness of covid-19.
For an already-approved drug (such as hydroxychloroquine for malaria), phase iii-iv trials determine in hundreds to thousands of covid-19-infected people the possible extended use of an already-approved drug for treating covid-19 infection.
As of early april 2020, 103 candidate therapeutics were in preclinical or a stage of phase i-iv development, with trial results for 29 drug candidates expected during april.
In march, the world health organization (who) launched the coordinated "solidarity trial" in 10 countries to rapidly assess in thousands of covid-19 infected people the potential efficacy of existing antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents not yet evaluated specifically for covid-19 illness.
Do any of the drugs reduce mortality?
Do any of the drugs reduce the time a patient is hospitalized?
Do the treatments affect the need for people with covid-19-induced pneumonia to be ventilated or maintained in intensive care?
Could such drugs be used to minimize the illness of covid-19 infection in healthcare staff and people at high risk of developing severe illness? Enrolling people with covid-19 infection is simplified by using data entries, including informed consent, on a who website.
After the trial staff determines the drugs available at the hospital, the who website randomizes the hospitalized subject to one of the trial drugs or to the hospital standard of care for treating covid-19.
The trial physician records and submits follow-up information about the subject status and treatment, completing data input via the who solidarity website.
A global safety monitoring board of who physicians examine interim results to assist decisions on safety and effectiveness of the trial drugs, and alter the trial design or recommend an effective therapy.
A similar web-based study to solidarity, called "discovery", was initiated in march across seven countries by inserm (paris, france) .during march, funding for the solidarity trial reached us $108 million from 203,000 individuals, organizations and governments, with 45 countries involved in financing or trial management.
Numerous candidate drugs under study as "supportive" treatments to relieve discomfort during illness, such as nsaids or bronchodilators, are not included in the table below.
Others in early-stage phase ii trials or numerous treatment candidates in phase i trials, are also excluded.
Drug candidates in phase i-ii trials have a low rate of success (under 12%) to pass through all trial phases to gain eventual approval.
Hydroxychloroquine is more commonly available than chloroquine in the united states.
Although several countries use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for treatment of persons hospitalized with covid-19, as of march 2020 the drug has not been formally approved through clinical trials in the united states.
Chloroquine has been recommended by chinese, south korean and italian health authorities for the treatment of covid-19, although these agencies and the us cdc noted contraindications for people with heart disease or diabetes.
Both drugs have extensive interactions with prescription drugs, affecting the therapeutic dose and disease mitigation.
Some people have allergic reactions to these drugs.on 12 april, a preliminary clinical trial conducted at a hospital in brazil was stopped when several people given high doses of chloroquine for covid-19 infection developed irregular heart rates, causing 11 deaths.
Chinese clinical trials in wuhan and shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Of 35 patients in shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The term "preclinical research" is defined by laboratory studies in vitro and in vivo, indicating a beginning stage for development of a vaccine, antiviral or monoclonal antibody therapy, such as experiments to determine effective doses and toxicity, before a candidate compound is advanced for safety and efficacy evaluation in humans.
Some antibiotics may be repurposed as covid-19 treatments:
In march 2020, the main protease of the sars-cov-2 virus was identified as a target for post-infection drugs.
This enzyme is essential to the host cell to reproduce the ribonucleic acid of the virus.
To find the enzyme, scientists used the genome published by chinese researchers in january 2020 to isolate the main protease.
As a potential combination therapy, they are used together in two phase iii arms of the 2020 global solidarity project on covid-19.
A preliminary study in china of combined lopinavir and ritonavir found no effect in people hospitalized for covid-19.
It is unclear yet whether conditions arising during pregnancy including diabetes, cardiac failure, hypercoagulability or hypertension might represent additional risk factors for pregnant people as they do for nonpregnant people.from the limited data available, vertical transmission during the third trimester probably does not occur, or only occurs very rarely.
There is no data yet on early pregnancy.
Little evidence exists to permit any solid conclusions about the nature of covid-19 infection in pregnancy.
A case series of 43 women from new york who tested positive for covid-19 showed similar patterns to non-pregnant adults: 86% had mild disease, 9.3% had severe disease and 4.7% developed critical disease.
Fetal distress was reported in two.
None of the women developed severe covid-19 pneumonia or died.
All of them had live birth pregnancies and no severe neonatal asphyxia was observed.
The samples of breast milk, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat swab were tested for sars-cov-2, and all results were negative.in another study on 15 pregnant women, majority of the patients presented with fever and cough, while laboratory tests yielded lymphocytopenia in 12 patients.
Computed tomography findings of these patients were consistent with previous reports of non-pregnant patients, consisting of ground-glass opacities at early stage.
Follow-up images after delivery showed no progression of pneumonia.media reports indicate that over 100 women with covid-19 might have delivered, and in march 2020, no maternal deaths were reported.
Their guidelines thus advise that any pregnant person admitted to hospital with a covid-19 infection should receive at least 10 days of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin after being discharged from the hospital.
There are no data yet concerning the implications of covid-19 infections for labour.
One infant girl born to a mother with covid-19 had elevated igm levels two hours after birth, suggesting that she had been infected in utero and supporting the possibility of vertical transmission in some cases.
A small study involving 6 confirmed covid-19 mothers showed no indication of sars-cov-19 in their newborns' throats or serum but antibodies were present in neonatal blood sera samples, including igm in two of the infants.
This is not usually passed from mother to fetus so further research is required to know whether the virus crossed the placenta or whether placentas of women in the study were damaged or abnormal.
Since covid-19 shows similarities to sars-cov and mers-cov, it is likely that their effect on pregnancy are similar.
Four of seven had first trimester miscarriage, two of five had fetal growth restriction in the second trimester, and four of five had preterm birth.
None of the newborns were infected with sars-cov.
A report of ten cases of mers- cov infection in pregnancy in saudi arabia showed that the clinical presentation is variable, from mild to severe infection.
The outcome was favorable in a majority of the cases, but the infant death rate was 27% .a recent review suggested that covid-19 appeared to be less lethal to mothers and infants than sars and mers but that there may be an increased risk of preterm birth after 28 weeks' gestation.
The world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention of the united states advises pregnant women to do the same things as the general public to avoid infection, such as covering cough, avoid interacting with sick people, cleaning hands with soap and water or sanitizer.
A survey conducted in shanghai among pregnant women in different trimesters of pregnancy identified a strong demand for online access to health information and services.
People expecting their first baby were more willing to have online consultation and guidance than who had previously given birth.the rcog and rcm recommend that in-person appointments be deferred by 7 days after the start of symptoms of covid-19 or 14 days if another person in the household has symptoms.
Fever subsequently developed in three asymptomatic patients.
One patient who had tested negative subsequently became symptomatic postpartum and tested positive three days after the initial negative test.
The doctors conducting the screening recommended that in order to reduce infection and allocate ppe, due to high numbers of patients presenting as asymptomatic, universal screening of pregnant patients should be conducted.
They also suggest that people with suspected or confirmed covid-19 should have continuous electronic fetal monitoring.
The use of birthing pools is not recommended for suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 due to the risk of infection via faeces.
In the uk, official recommendations state that precautionary separation of a mother and a healthy baby should not be undertaken lightly and that they should be kept together in the postpartum period where neonatal care is not required.literature from china recommended separation of infected mothers from babies for 14 days.
In the us there is also the recommendation that newborns and mothers should be temporarily separated until transmission-based precautions are discontinued, and that where this is not possible the newborn should be kept 2 metres away from the mother.
B'covid-19 surveillance involves monitoring the spread of the coronavirus disease in order to establish the patterns of disease progression.
The world health organization (who) recommends active surveillance, with focus of case finding, testing and contact tracing in all transmission scenarios.
Covid-19 surveillance is expected to monitor epidemiological trends, rapidly detect new cases, and based on this information, provide epidemiological information to conduct risk assessment and guide disease preparedness.
Syndromic surveillance is done based on the symptoms of an individual that corresponds to covid-19.
As of march 2020, the who recommends the following case definitions:
Probable case: "A suspect case for whom testing for the covid-19 virus is inconclusive" or "a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason".
Confirmed case: "A person with laboratory confirmation of covid-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms".
Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed covid-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment;
Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments ".who recommends reporting of probable and confirmed cases of covid-19 infection within 48 hours of identification.
The countries should report on a case-by-case basis as far as possible, but in case of limitation in resources, aggregate weekly reporting is also possible.
Some organizations have created crowdsourced apps for syndromic surveillance, where people can report their symptoms to help researchers map areas with concentration of covid-19 symptoms.
Virological surveillance is done by using molecular tests for covid-19.
Who has published resources for laboratories on how to perform testing for covid-19.
In the european union, laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 are reported within 24 hours of identification.
At least 24 countries have established digital surveillance of their citizens.
The digital surveillance technologies include apps, location data and electronic tags.
The center for disease control and prevention in usa tracks the travel information of individuals using airline passenger data.
In hong kong, authorities are requiring a bracelet and an app for all travellers.
A gps app is used to track the locations of individuals in south korea to ensure against quarantine breach, sending alerts to the user and to authorities if people leave designated areas.
In singapore, individuals have to report their locations with photographic proof.
Thailand is using an app and sim cards for all travelers to enforce their quarantine.
Human rights organizations have criticized some of these measures, asking the governments not to use the pandemic as a cover to introduce invasive digital surveillance.
B'coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19.
Symptoms in other species vary: In chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea.
There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily orthocoronavirinae, in the family coronaviridae, order nidovirales, and realm riboviria.
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among rna viruses.
They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona from which their name derives.
Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (ibv).
In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), were isolated.human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s.
The earliest ones studied were from human patients with the common cold, which were later named human coronavirus 229e and human coronavirus oc43.
They were first imaged by scottish virologist june almeida at st. thomas hospital in london.
Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including sars-cov in 2003, hcov nl63 in 2004, hku1 in 2005, mers-cov in 2012, and sars-cov-2 in 2019.
Most of these have involved serious respiratory tract infections.
The name was first used in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal nature to designate the new family of viruses.
The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of a crown or of a solar corona.
This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.
Coronaviruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections.
The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells.the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the membrane (m), envelope (e) and spike (s) structural proteins are anchored.
The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.
Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded rna genome.
The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases.
The genome size is one of the largest among rna viruses.
The open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the first two-thirds of the genome, encode the replicase / transcriptase polyprotein.
The replicase / transcriptase polyprotein self cleaves to form nonstructural proteins.the later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: Spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid.
Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins.
The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.
Infection begins when the viral spike (s) glycoprotein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor.
After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein.
Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelop with the host membrane.on entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm.
The host ribosome translates the initial overlapping open reading frame of the virus genome and forms a long polyprotein.
The polyprotein has its own proteases which cleave the polyprotein into multiple nonstructural proteins.
A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (rtc).
The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).
It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of rna from an rna strand.
The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process.
The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the rna-dependent rna polymerase lacks.one of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome.
Rdrp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic rna from the positive-sense genomic rna.
This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic rna from the negative-sense genomic rna.
The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome.
Rdrp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic rna molecules from the positive-sense genomic rna.
This is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic rna molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mrnas.
The replicated positive-sense genomic rna becomes the genome of the progeny viruses.
The mrnas are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame.
These mrnas are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and a number of accessory proteins.
Rna translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum.
The viral structural proteins s, e, and m move along the secretory pathway into the golgi intermediate compartment.
There, the m proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid.
Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles.
The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complement host cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the virus.
The sars coronavirus, for example, infects human cells by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor.
The scientific name for coronavirus is orthocoronavirinae or coronavirinae.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviridae, order nidovirales, and realm riboviria.
Genus betacoronavirus; type species: Murine coronavirus
Species: Betacoronavirus 1 (bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus oc43), human coronavirus hku1, murine coronavirus, pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5, rousettus bat coronavirus hku9, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sars-cov, sars-cov-2), tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4, middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, hedgehog coronavirus 1 (ericov)
Species: Beluga whale coronavirus sw1, infectious bronchitis virus
The most recent common ancestor (mrca) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 bce, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.
The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 bce, the betacoronavirus line at 3300 bce, the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 bce, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 bce.
The large number of host bat and avian species, and their global range, has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.many human coronavirus have their origin in bats.
More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229e diverged sometime before 1960.
Mers-cov emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels.
Mers-cov, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.
The most closely related bat coronavirus and sars-cov diverged in 1986.
A possible path of evolution, of sars coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses, suggests that sars related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time.
In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump.
Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus oc43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event.
It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic.
Human coronavirus oc43 besides causing respiratory infections is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases.
In the 1950s, the human coronavirus oc43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.
Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and the central nervous system, is related to human coronavirus oc43 and bovine coronavirus.
Human coronavirus hku1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.
Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor.
Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as mers-cov, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.
Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.
Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).
The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, sars-cov, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.
Four of these coronaviruses continually circulate in the human population and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold in adults and children worldwide: -oc43, -hku1, hcov-229e, -nl63.
Coronaviruses cause about 15% of commons colds.
The majority of colds are caused by rhinoviruses.
The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.
There is no preference towards a particular season in tropical climates.
Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild:
The virus was officially named the sars coronavirus (sars-cov).
More than 8,000 people were infected, about ten percent of whom died.
In september 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called novel coronavirus 2012, and now officially named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov).
The world health organization issued a global alert soon after.
The who update on 28 september 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.
However, on 12 may 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in france was confirmed by the french ministry of social affairs and health.
In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the ministry of health in tunisia.
Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to qatar and saudi arabia.
Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus.
The final name for the virus is middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov).
The only u.s. cases (both survived) were recorded in may 2014.in may 2015, an outbreak of mers-cov occurred in the republic of korea, when a man who had traveled to the middle east, visited four hospitals in the seoul area to treat his illness.
This caused one of the largest outbreaks of mers-cov outside the middle east.
As of december 2019, 2,468 cases of mers-cov infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.
In december 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in wuhan, china.
On 31 december 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-ncov by the world health organization (who), later renamed sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses.
Some researchers have suggested the huanan seafood wholesale market may not be the original source of viral transmission to humans.as of 17 april 2020, there have been at least 153,822 confirmed deaths and more than 2,240,191 confirmed cases in the coronavirus pneumonia pandemic.
The wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of betacoronavirus from group 2b with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the sars-cov.
The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.
The pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and nationwide lockdowns in several countries.
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s.
Except for avian infectious bronchitis, the major related diseases have mainly an intestinal location.
Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.
They also cause a range of diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets, some of which can be serious and are a threat to the farming industry.
In chickens, the infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), a coronavirus, targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract.
The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken.
Economically significant coronaviruses of farm animals include porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, tge) and bovine coronavirus, which both result in diarrhea in young animals.
Feline coronavirus: Two forms, feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (fip), a disease associated with high mortality.
Similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets: Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ece), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like fip in cats) known as ferret systemic coronavirus (fsc).
There are two types of canine coronavirus (ccov), one that causes mild gastrointestinal disease and one that has been found to cause respiratory disease.
Mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.
Sialodacryoadenitis virus (sdav) is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol.
Some strains of mhv cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis.
Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.
Porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs, tgev).
Bovine coronavirus (bcv), responsible for severe profuse enteritis in of young calves.
Feline coronavirus (fcov) causes mild enteritis in cats as well as severe feline infectious peritonitis (other variants of the same virus).
The two types of canine coronavirus (ccov) (one causing enteritis, the other found in respiratory diseases).
Turkey coronavirus (tcv) causes enteritis in turkeys.
Ferret enteric coronavirus causes epizootic catarrhal enteritis in ferrets.
Ferret systemic coronavirus causes fip-like systemic syndrome in ferrets.
Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young european rabbits.
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (ped or pedv), has emerged around the world.

Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (covid-19) in the european union / european economic area and the united kingdom, 1 january to 15 march 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (covid-19) cases is showing similar trends in european union / european economic area countries and the united kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the covid-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with covid-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 december 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in wuhan, hubei province, china.
On 9 january 2020, the china center for disease control and prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).
Since, the illness resulting from sars-cov-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (covid-19).
Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with covid-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca 14% cases, covid-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to covid-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of covid-19 in each european union / european economic area (eu / eea) country and the united kingdom (uk) and compare them to that of hubei province, china.
We also compare the current number of covid-19 cases in eu / eea countries and the uk with that in italy during 31 january – 15 march 2020.
Covid-19 cases in eu / eea countries and the uk
Subsequent to china, covid-19 underwent further geographical spread and the dynamic of the covid-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 march 2020, the director general of the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 march issue of eurosurveillance 2020, spiteri et al. reported on the first european confirmed covid-19 cases according to the who case definition.
In the eu / eea, the first three confirmed cases were reported by france on 24 january 2020 in persons returning from wuhan, hubei province, china.
As at 15 march 2020, covid-19 cases had been detected in all 30 eu / eea countries and the united kingdom (uk), whereby between 31 december 2019 and that date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of covid-19 cases
At the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), the notified covid-19 case counts in each country worldwide, obtained from only official sources such as the countries ’ ministry of health, national and regional health authorities and the who, are updated each day at 8: 00 a.m.
These data were used for assessing the trends of covid-19 in eu / eea and the uk, and comparing them to that in italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active covid-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of covid-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of covid-19, in each eu / eea country and the uk, during the 1 january – 15 march 2020 period.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 march 2020 8: 00 a.m. compared with that of italy for the 31 january – 15 march 2020 period.
Trends of covid-19 in eu / eea countries and the uk
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of covid-19 cases in eu / eea countries and the uk generally followed that of hubei province (china) (figure 1).
For the eu / eea and the uk overall, the cumulative incidence of covid-19 started to increase around 21 february and then increased sharply around 28 february 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from italy, but all other eu / eea countries and the uk showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of covid-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of covid-19 cases, in eu / eea countries and the uk compared with that in italy for the 31 january – 15 march 2020 period.
It highlights that, as at 15 march 8: 00 a.m., 15 other eu / eea countries and the uk had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of italy just 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of covid-19 is rapidly increasing in the eu / eea and the uk.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of covid-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of covid-19, including catch-up testing.
Early march 2020, doctors in the affected regions of italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with covid-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of covid-19 cases in a hospital and / or an intensive care unit are currently available at eu / eea level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study performed in 2010 – 11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in europe, ranging from 29.2 in germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010 – 11).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each eu / eea country and the uk of the prevalence of hospitalised covid-19 cases associated with a & gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ecdc rapid risk assessment on covid-19.
Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in eu / eea countries and the uk, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (nuts-2) level.
The experience from italy and the current trends in other countries show that the covid-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the eu / eea and the uk.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of sars-cov-2 and an increase in the number of patients with covid-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of italy.
As pointed out in the recent ecdc rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of sars-cov-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of sars-cov-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other eu / eea countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in china and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, sars-cov, which caused sars in thousands of people in 2003, sars-cov-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, covid-19 has lower severity and mortality than sars but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
The spring festival on january 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (cov) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003; thus, it was named sars-cov-2 by the world health organization (who) on february 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named cov disease-19 (covid-19).
The epidemic started in wuhan, china, and quickly spread throughout the entire country and to near 50 others all over the world.
As of march 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of covid-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died.
Who warns that covid-19 is “public enemy number 1 ” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to pubmed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months, over 200 papers have been published on covid-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on january 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare covid-19 with sars and another cov-caused disease, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
Covs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human covs twice, i.e., sars-cov and mers-cov, which caused an outbreak originally in china in 2003 and saudi arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current covid-19 is the third cov outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in fig. ​ fig.1,1, clusters of pneumonia that had unknown origins were first reported from wuhan on december 31, 2019 to the china national health commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the cov was released.
On january 15, 2020 the first fatal case from wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On january 20, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On january 23, the city of wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation stopped.
On january 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the wuhan seafood market that was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On january 30, who declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout china and near 50 other countries all over the world (fig. ​ (fig.2) .2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On february 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed covid-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / ulbi-hx _ rhpxa1qha2bhda).
Sars-cov-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
Sars-cov-2 infected more men (0.31 / 100,000) than women (0.27 / 100,000).
Covid-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around hubei.
Covid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (r0) was 3.77 (95% ci: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted r0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 jan. 2020, matching the time of massive transportation before the spring festival in china.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% ci: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 3.06% (95% ci: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for covid-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Covs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense rna.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-covs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (s) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) for sars-cov and mers-cov, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral rna genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic rna accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 was reported on january 10, 2020.
Sars-cov-2 was found to be a new type of beta-cov with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the huanan seafood market in wuhan.
Sars-cov-2 is genetically more similar to sars-cov than to mers-cov.
Through transmission electron microscopy, sars-cov-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ace2 was found to be a receptor for sars-cov-2 as well as sars-cov.
However, the s protein of sars-cov-2 binds to human ace2 more weakly than that of sars-cov, which is coincident with the fact that sars-cov-2 causes less severe infection in patients than sars-cov.
Sars-cov-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of sars-cov-2 may play a role in the viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of ifnβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On february 18, 2020, zhou, et al., reported the cryo-em structure of the full-length human ace2 at 2.9 å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter b0at1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and the ace2-b0at1 complex can bind two s proteins, which provides evidence for cov recognition and infection.
B0at1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress sars-cov-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It has been known that both sars-cov and mers-cov originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of sars-cov-2 with other covs, bats were considered the native host of sars-cov-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two sars-like covs from bats called bat-sl-covzx45 and bat-sl-covzx21.
However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the s protein.
According to a study, researchers in guangzhou, china, suggested that pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of sars-cov-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a cov discovered in pangolins and sars-cov-2.
However, 1% difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (fig. ​ (fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of sars-cov-2 are largely not yet known.
Sars-cov and mers-cov can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 ° c and 40% -50% humidity.
Sars-cov-2 may possess similar properties.
It has been reported that sars-cov-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 ° c for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to sars-cov-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to sars-cov-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other covs, especially sars-cov and mers-cov (fig. ​ (fig.4) .4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (prrs) including c-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr), nod-like receptor (nlr), and rig-i-like receptor (rlr).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type i interferons (ifns) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the n protein of sars-cov can help the virus escape from the immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including cd4 + and cd8 + t cells play an important role in the defense.
Cd4 + t cells stimulate b cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and cd8 + t cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, cov can inhibit t cell functions by inducing apoptosis of t cells.
The humoral immunity including complements such as c3a and c5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized mers-cov.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damages to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.
The sars-cov-2 infection, featured by clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, they have higher chance to be infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of sars-cov-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases demonstrates that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of covid-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and / or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly progressed to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late december of 2019 showed that the percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
Comparably, a demographic study in 2012 showed that mers-cov patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, much more than covid-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of mers than of covid-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with mers patients.
In sars patients, it has been demonstrated that fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnea (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% -20% of the patients.
By february 14, the mortality of covid-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the mortality of sars by november 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For mers, based on a demographic study in june 2012, the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the r0 of sars-cov-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (ci) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the r0 of sars-cov only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of sars-cov-2 with mers-cov and sara-cov regarding their symptoms, mortality, and r0 is presented in table ​ table1.1.
The above figures suggest that sars-cov-2 has a higher ability to spread than mers-cov and sars-cov, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of sars-cov-2 than those of mers-cov and sars-cov.
Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count & lt; 4 × 109 / l including lymphocyte count & lt; 1 × 109 / l, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 covid-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of d-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most covid-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).
When ards happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-i and type-ii pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.
On february 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of covid-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ards and similar to that of sars and mers patients.
The detection of sars-cov-2 rna via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of covid-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on rt-pcr) in china on february 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of sars.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On february 14, 2020, the feng zhang group described a protocol of using the crispr-based sherlock technique to detect sars-cov-2, which detects synthetic sars-cov-2 rna fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol / l to 200 × 10-18 mol / l (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel cov, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to covid-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other covs such as sars-cov and mers-cov and other viral diseases (table ​ (table2) .2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Sars-cov-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ace2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential for sars-cov-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in sars and mers patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by the release of a series of cytokines including tnfα, il-1β, il-2, il-6, ifnα, ifnβ, ifnγ, and mcp-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of ards and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-il6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of t cell-directed immune response; the blockade of ifn-γ, il-1, and tnf; jak inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and hdac inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of sars to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in sars and covid-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill covid-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an american patient with covid-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by ebola and marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded rna viruses including mers and sars viruses.
Based on these, gilead has provided the compound to china to conduct a pair of trials on sars-cov-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir / ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir / ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (ig) produced by b lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from covid-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate b cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way, we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies.
Tcm has been used to treat a variety of diseases in china for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of tcm.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for covid-19, tcm has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, shu feng jie du capsules and lian hua qing wen capsules were found to be effective for covid-19 treatment.
Top cure rates in the treatment of covid-19 patients were observed in several provinces in china that used tcm in 87% of their patients, including gansu (63.7%), ningxia (50%), and hunan (50%), whereas hubei province, which used tcm in only approximately 30% of its covid-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On february 18, 2020, boli zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine (wm) treatment alone with combined treatment of wm and tcm.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the wm + tcm group than in the wm only group.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower for the wm + tcm group than for the wm only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the wm + tcm group than wm only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of tcm still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of tcm treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the sars outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health responses to the covid-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to covid-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates about the sars-cov-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop s protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immunity against sars-cov.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for sars.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because sars died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of mers continue to occur in the middle east and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for mers by using inactivated virus, dna plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of covs.
As a novel disease, covid-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to sars and mers, covid-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of covid-19 patients (table ​ (table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of sars, which is also true for covid-19.
Covid-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of covid-19 patients.
Sex: Sars-cov-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with covid-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in sars patients.
It has been reported that sars-cov-2 can also bind to ace2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in covid-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The c-reactive protein (crp) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of crp level to the severity and prognosis of covid-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine aminotransferase (alt), and creatine kinase (ck) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of covid-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe sars patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in covid-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the covid-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, covid-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from sars.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, sars-cov-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other covs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, the transmission of sars-cov was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of covid-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of sars.
Great efforts are currently underway in china including the lockdown of wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of sars-cov-2.
Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by march and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul hunter, et al., estimated that covid-19, which seems substantially more infectious than sars, will not end in 2020.
Ira longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that sars-cov-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A canadian group reported that sars-cov-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have occurred in china based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.
It is possible, similar to sars-cov, that sars-cov-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of covid-19 with that of sars and mers is provided below (fig. ​ (fig.55).
Sars-cov-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and n95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only n95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; sars-cov-2 is similar to sars-cov in size and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear n95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On january 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with sars-cov-2 although he wore an n95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to lower the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although sars-cov-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to sars-cov as reported on 7 january 2020 should have caused high alert to china based on her deep memory of the sars outbreak in 2003.
However, not until 19 january 2020 did the director of the center of disease control of wuhan comfort the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the spring festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in wuhan.
The disease control agencies in china may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements as every word counts to citizens and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its early stage rather than attempting to comfort the public; and (4) more often to issue targeted and effective drills to increase the public's awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of the society periodically.
The outbreak of covid-19 caused by the novel virus sars-cov-2 started in the end of december 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread all over china and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to sars-cov and the symptoms are also similar between covid-19 and sars, the outbreak of covid-19 has created a sense of sars recurring.
However, there are some remarkable differences between covid-19 and sars, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.
Covid-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
Sars has higher mortality than covid-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas sars patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which causes much greater difficulty to contain the spread of covid-19 than sars.
This partially explains why sars-cov-2 spread much faster and broader than sars-cov.
The regular rna assay for sars-cov-2 can be negative in some covid-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in research on covid-19, several critical issues remain to be solved, as follows:
Where did sars-cov-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog was found between sars-cov-2 and two bat sars-like covs, we still cannot conclude that sars-cov-2 is from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers to # 1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transmission, and the outbreak can relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that sars-cov-2 binds to ace2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ace2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission among humans?
Will it become a pandemic worldwide, die down like sars or relapse periodically like the flu?
It is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, with whatever expense it may demand, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (covs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human covs (hcovs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an hcov infection could be.
The emergence of sars-cov-2 in central china at the end of 2019 has thrusted covs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister sars-cov.

Hcov infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of hcovs would serve us well.
Most hcovs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some hcovs are also known.
Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating cov-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on cov pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven hcovs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the different hcovs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current cov disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (covs) belong to the family coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded rna viruses.
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst rna viruses were termed “covs ” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
Structurally, covs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (orf1a and orf1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains orfs for the structural proteins, including spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleoprotein (n).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of covs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, covs are classified into four genera (alpha-cov, beta-cov, gamma-cov and delta-cov), among which the beta-cov genera contains most hcovs and is subdivided into four lineages (a, b, c and d).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-covs and beta-covs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-covs and delta-covs.
For thousands of years, covs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human covs (hcovs) are known.
Among them hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are alpha-covs.
The other five beta-covs include hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) and sars-cov-2.
Hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 usually cause mild symptoms, like common cold and / or diarrhea.
In contrast, sars-cov, mers-cov and the newly-identified sars-cov-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first hcov-229e strain, b814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was accumulated through extensive studies on hcov-229e and hcov-oc43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, the concept had been widely accepted that infection with hcovs is generally harmless until the outbreak of sars.
The sars outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude case fatality of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the arabian peninsula with sporadic spreading to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel hcov (2019-ncov), which has subsequently been renamed sars-cov-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of march 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of sars-cov-2.
All seven hcovs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all hcovs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The covid-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to china and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of hcovs provides a framework to understand the natural history, driving force and restriction factors of species jumping.
This might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host (s) of sars-cov-2, with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of hcovs.
Particularly, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of hcovs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of hcov evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing sars-cov-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal covs have been known since late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of hcov-229e strain b814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold, different covs had been isolated in various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven hcovs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of hcov discovery in chronological order (table ​ 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first hcov-229e strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year of 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow in wi-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with hcov-229e presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10 ~ 20% cases.
Later in 1967, hcov-oc43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of suckling mice.
The clinical features of hcov-oc43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by hcov-229e, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza a viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 are distributed globally, and they tend to be predominantly transmitted during the season of winter in temperate climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by an approximately 2-week illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with hcov-229e developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
Sars, also known as “atypical pneumonia ”, was the first well documented hcov-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is sars-cov, the third hcov discovered.
The first case of sars can be traced back to late 2002 in guangdong province of china.
The sars epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with sars-cov initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of sars.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in sars patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm, which might be lethal particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to hong kong from guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to hcov research.
Hcov-nl63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by hcov-nl63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the netherlands.
Although it was identified in netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that hcov-nl63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
Hcov-nl63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, hcov-hku1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in hong kong.
Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, hcov-hku1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to hcov-nl63, hcov-229e and hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired hcovs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, though accidents did occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of hcov-nl63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in china.
Generally, when these hcovs acquire the abilities to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-cov was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in saudi arabia.
Whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the middle east, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various european countries and tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in south korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of mers resemble those of sars, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike sars, many patients with mers also developed acute renal failure, which is thus far unique for mers among hcov-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of february 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making mers-cov one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
During middle to late december 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be associated with sars-cov-2 infection were detected in wuhan, hubei province, china.
World health organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by sars-cov-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease covid-19.
As of march 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality in hubei, china is 4.2%, whereas the one outside of it is 1.2%.
Sars-cov-2 causes severe respiratory infection like sars-cov and mers-cov, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Sars-cov-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to sars-cov and mers-cov.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with sars-cov-2 have been reported and might contribute to its rapid spreading around the world.
Comparing and contrasting sars-cov-2 with the other six hcovs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of hcov disease are very similar.
In this regard, sars-cov-2 follows the general trend of the other six hcovs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of covid-19 lies between sars-cov and the four community-acquired hcovs (i.e. hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63).
On one hand, sars-cov-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired hcovs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of covid-19 can also be seen as in the case of sars-cov infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of sars-cov-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired hcovs and sars-cov.
On one hand, the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired hcovs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of sars-cov and mers-cov.
Finally, same as the other hcovs, sars-cov-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of sars-cov-2 plays an important role as in the case of sars-cov at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether sars-cov-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired hcovs.
Nevertheless, the features of sars-cov-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of covid-19.
All four community-acquired hcovs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four hcovs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient hcov pandemics.
Hcovs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe hcov diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, hcovs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the sars-cov-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired covs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic sars-cov and mers-cov have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
Sars-cov-2 has features that are similar to both sars-cov / mers-cov and the four community-acquired hcovs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired hcovs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired hcovs and less pathogenic than sars-cov or mers-cov.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of hcovs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of hcovs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an hcov if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbours hcov continuously and for long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of hcov or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the hcov is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
An hcov can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, hcovs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of sars had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-sars-cov igg compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry sars-cov-like viruses that are almost identical to sars-cov.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further sars was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for sars-cov, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of sars-cov.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in guangzhou have anti-sars-cov antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of sars-cov cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of sars-cov.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of sars-cov unveiled a closely related bat cov, termed sars-related rhinolophus bat cov hku3 (sarsr-rh-batcov hku3), which exists in chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-sars-cov antibodies and genome sequence of sarsr-rh-batcov hku3.
This and other bat covs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with sars-cov.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several sars-like covs (sl-covs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated wiv1 can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is known to be the receptor of sars-cov.
Wiv1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ace2 as receptor for cell entry.
Intriguingly, sera of convalescent sars patients were capable of neutralizing wiv1.
Thus far, wiv1 represents the most closely related ancestor of sars-cov in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that wiv1 is not the immediate parental virus of sars-cov and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of sars-cov.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters mers-cov to the same group as bat cov-hku4 and bat cov-hku5.
Bat cov-hku4 and mers-cov utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), for virus entry.
Rna-dependent rna polymerase sequences of mers-cov are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-covs identified from europe and africa.
Up to now, no live mers-cov can be found in wild bats.
Mers-cov and its closest relative bat cov-hku25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of mers-cov.
On the other hand, studies in middle east have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for mers-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of middle east origin in multiple african countries.
Live mers-cov identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of mers-cov.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with mers-cov.
Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.
However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of mers have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour mers-cov.
Sars-cov-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat cov ratg13 isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of sars-cov and mers-cov, the sequence divergence between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host (s) of sars-cov-2 unless almost identical bat covs are found in future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of sars-cov-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of covid-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-covs related to sars-cov-2.
These novel pangolin cov genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with sars-cov-2.
However, they are equally closely related to ratg13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They cluster into two sub-lineages of sars-cov-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (rbd) with sars-cov-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the rbds of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to sars-cov-2.
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of sars-cov-2.
However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of sars-cov-2 due to the sequence divergence between sars-cov-2 and pangolin sars-cov-2-related beta-covs.
In addition, the distance between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 is even shorter than that between sars-cov-2 and pangolin sars-cov-2-related beta-covs.
The evolutionary pathway of sars-cov-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the rbds between sars-cov-2 and pangolin, sars-cov-2-related beta-covs, sars-cov-2 and ratg13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the rbds of pangolin sars-cov-2-related beta-covs and sars-cov-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin sars-cov-2-related beta-cov and ratg13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-covs.
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of sars-cov-2.
Besides the highly pathogenic hcovs, the zoonotic origin of hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e might have originated from bat covs, while the parental viruses of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat cov termed arcov.2 (appalachian ridge cov) detected in north american tricolored bat displayed close relationship with hcov-nl63.
On the other hand, hcov-229e was genetically related to another bat cov, termed hipposideros / ghanakwam / 19 / 2008, which was detected in ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known hcovs is summarized in figure ​ 1 and table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of hcovs in the history.
When hcov-oc43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of hcov-229e is less clear.
Bat alpha-covs closely related to hcov-229e have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-cov.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, hcov-229e-related bat alpha-covs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-cov caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-cov has not been found in feral animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the hcov-229e-related alpha-cov from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, ebola virus, nipah virus and hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit hcov-229e to humans directly.
Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-covs serve as the gene pool of hcov-229e, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of mers-cov.
Mers-cov serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of mers-cov from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, mers-cov has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
Mers-cov causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of mers-cov as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of mers-cov, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of sars-cov-2 is different.
Particularly, pangolin beta-covs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They might be a dead-end host for sars-cov-2-related beta-covs, similar to civets in the case of sars-cov.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of sars-cov-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a sars-cov-2-related virus almost identical to sars-cov-2.
Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a sars-cov-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to sars-cov-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of sars-cov-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of sars-cov-2 is still on.
Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating covs to cross species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in rna replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded rna viruses, the estimated mutation rates of covs could be regarded as “moderate ” to“ high ” with an average substitution rate being ~ 10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of cov adaptation to novel hosts.
Covs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress cov replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the rna-dependent rna polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-sars-cov-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, mutation rates of covs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rate is often high when covs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to sars-cov with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to sars-cov-2, this also applies to mers-cov, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against sars-cov-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, the large rna genome in covs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel covs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3 ′ end of the genome.
Third, covs randomly and frequently switch templates during rna replication through a unique “copy-choice ” mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during cov rna transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic rnas could recombine to generate new covs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43, as well as animal covs such as bat sl-cov and batcov-hku9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.
Herein, recombination of sars-cov is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet sars-covs, sars-cov is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the rbd of the s protein.
Generally, the rbd in the s protein of a cov interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In sars-cov, the rbd is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the s1 fragment, which binds to the human ace2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The rbd of sars-cov is capable of recognizing the ace2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the rbd and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ace2 receptor.
Civet sars-cov has k479n and s487t mutations in its rbd, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ace2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.
It is noteworthy that sars-cov-2 shares the same cellular receptor with sars-cov.
A 30% difference between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in the s1 unit of the s protein implicates that the binding affinity of its s protein with human ace2 might have altered.
Indeed, a cryo-em study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ace2 and sars-cov s protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for sars-cov-2 transmission.
Intriguingly, hcov-nl63 also binds to ace2 but with a different part of s.
There exist many other hcov receptors, such as aminopeptidase n for hcov-229e, and 9-o-acetylated sialic acid for hcov-oc43.
They might also account for successful adaptation of these covs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of hcovs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of hcovs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Hcovs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for sars-cov-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of crispr might be fruitful.
Emergence of novel hcovs: Back to ground zero
The diversity of bat covs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel hcovs.
In this sense, bat covs serve as the gene pool of hcovs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive hcov evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among sars-cov accessory proteins, orf8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as sars-cov-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent orf8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of sars-covs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits orf8 into orf8a and orf8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.
Besides, sars-cov has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-covs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the rna-dependent rna polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic mers-cov experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in saudi arabia.
Besides sars-cov and mers-cov, recombination events have also been observed in other hcovs, in which the hcovs recombine with other animal covs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length orf4 in the hcov-229e prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact orf4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to hcov-229e, the alpaca alpha-cov displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel hcovs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with covs, indicating the mutual adaptation between covs and bats.
It appeared that bats are well adapted to covs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by covs.
Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor nkg2 / cd94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class i molecules.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ros) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress cov replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic cov strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel hcovs have emerged in the past two decades.
Covs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from cov replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-sars-cov-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type i interferon at least in the early phase of sars-cov-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, nlrp3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome with mcc950 might be useful in the treatment of covid-19.
The emergence of sars-cov-2 follows the general theme by which sars-cov and mers-cov arose.
Whereas a bat beta-cov sharing 95% nucleotide homology with sars-cov has been found, there also exists a bat-cov sharing 96% nucleotide homology with sars-cov-2.
Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to sars-cov, immediate intermediate hosts for sars-cov-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-covs strikingly homologous to sars-cov-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-covs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of sars-cov-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that sars-cov-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.
Covs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of sars-cov-2.
The study of covs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of hcovs in human transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that sars-cov, mers-cov and sars-cov-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that sars-cov infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the sars epidemic.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-covs closely related to sars-cov-2.
However, whether and how sars-cov-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, mers-cov has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed across the middle east and africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of mers, as what was done in wild animal markets in china to prevent the spreading of sars-cov and sars-cov-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of mers, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against mers-cov for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic covs are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat covs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic covs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new covs that are more transmissible and / or deadly in humans in future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places of china should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the ordeals of sars, mers and covid-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of covs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of sars-cov-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of sars-cov-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to sars-cov-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that sars-cov-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of sars-cov-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of covid-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of covid-19 “suspected case ” and“ confirmed case ” is necessary
On 6 february 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case ” and“ confirmed case ” according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for covid-19 (seventh version) that issued by the national health committee of the people ’ s republic of china.
In december 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).
On 11 march 2020, who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against the sars-cov-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in military medical research on 06 february 2020.
It has attracted a great attention since published.
Note however that covid-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
For instance the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for covid-19 issued by the national health committee of the people ’ s republic of china (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), among 16 january 2020 to 3 march 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed.
Now our guideline received a comment by zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
However, their work also needs update according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for covid-19 (trial seventh version) and recently studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 march 2020), to confirm the suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where covid-19 cases had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with sars-cov-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contacting with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where covid-19 had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (4) a history of contacting with cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and / or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, class of school, etc).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of covid-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following: (1) real-time pcr test positive for sars-cov-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific igm antibody and igg antibody to sars-cov-2 in serum test; or a change of the sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time pcr test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 january 2020) and third (22 january 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 january 2020) and fifth (8 february 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications based on the researchers continued work that to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the samples from respiratory tract including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens, and supported bringing the specific antibody positive result into the confirmed criteria.
Besides, there are more and more evidence that remind us to caution with the atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Hence, the flow chart of zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low risk ”.
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence coming up and call for readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case ” and“ confirmed case ”, we suggest to trace and obey the newest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to covid-19, a daily highest
Yesterday, bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to covid-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, bangladesh's institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (iedcr) reported the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of iedcr, dr meerjady sabrina flora, said the fatalities included four males and one female.
According to dr meerjady, two cases were aged above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from dhaka.
The world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a pandemic on march 11.
A hospital official told anadolu agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was jalal saifur rahman, a director of bengali anti-corruption commission, who was cared for at the kuwait maitree hospital.
On saturday, in an online video announcement, bangladeshi road transport and bridges minister obaidul quader said public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned, until this coming saturday.
This public transport shutdown had initially started on march 26 and was planned to end on saturday, april 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first recorded incidents of covid-19 infection in bangladesh were on march 8, in two people who returned from italy and also the wife of one of them.
As of march 19, these three had already recovered.
Sars-cov-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On thursday, the total number of cases of the sars-cov-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, johns hopkins university data indicated.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North korea claimed, as of thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free of coronavirus infections.
By yesterday, the world health organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 a.m. central european time (0800 utc) on april 4.
In the united states, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths.
Cbs news reported, citing johns hopkins university data, there were over 1,000 us deaths on wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from spreading.
On thursday, sergei sobyanin, the mayor of moscow, extended the city lockdown to may 1.
Nationally, president vladimir putin declared russians would continue to be paid without going to work until april 30.
The parliament of portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of mecca and medina to last the entire day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of ohio, mike dewine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until may 1.
Stores in australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On sunday and saturday evening, australian store chains woolworths and coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores on national level, respectively.
Aldi also introduced a one-pack limit, on monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' facebook pages.
Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of covid-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
On wednesday, woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by woolworths and coles on march 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in its march 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while aldi, in a facebook post on tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales went up in a "sharp increase" last week, according to a woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, woolworths ordered extra stock, while aldi made stocks for a planned wednesday special available early.
Russell zimmerman, executive director of the australian retailers association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard.
He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On tuesday, aldi announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the wednesday special.
In a news.com.au report, dr gary mortimer, retail expert from queensland university of technology, said the stores fill the stock every night.
He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage.
Coles and woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic said russell zimmerman per abc news.
Recycled toilet paper producer who gives a crap said on last wednesday they'd run out of stock.
Kimberly-clark, which makes kleenex toilet tissue, and solaris paper which makes sorbent, emphasized they were working 24 / 7 to maintain the supply, according to the news.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of labour day.
The thursday edition of nt news, a daily printed in darwin, included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from abc australia on march 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.
Russell zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside of australia, on sunday evening online british supermarket ocado was observed limiting purchases of andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
World health organization declares covid-19 pandemic
On wednesday, the world health organization (who) declared the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus sars-cov-2 — to be a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how widely a disease has spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, the who noted the need to drive governments to action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response, said tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the director-general of the who.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to dr. tom frieden, formerly the director of the united states' centers for disease control and prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in remarks published by cnn in february, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the who's decision in january to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The united states' national institute of allergy and infectious disease's director, dr. anthony fauci, said of the outbreak, "bottom line, it's going to get worse."
As of thursday, associated press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of covid-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019 – 20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).
The outbreak was identified in wuhan, china, in december 2019, declared to be a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 march 2020.
As of 10 april 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of covid-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in china, while globally ranging from 13.04% in algeria to .08% in new zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against chinese people, other people of east and southeast asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in wuhan, china (the capital of hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 december 2019, and an investigation was launched in early january 2020.
The cases mostly had links to the huanan seafood wholesale market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as sars-cov-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and sars-cov.the earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 december 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
Of the early cluster of cases reported in december 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On 13 march 2020, an unverified report from the south china morning post suggested that a case traced back to 17 november 2019, in a 55-year-old from hubei province, may have been the first.on 26 february 2020, the who reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in china but suddenly increased in italy, iran, and south korea, the number of new cases outside china had exceeded the number of new cases within china for the first time.
There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.
By 26 february, relatively few cases had been reported among youths, with those 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.the united kingdom's chief scientific adviser, patrick vallance, estimated that 60% of the british population would need to become infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for covid-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 march, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as italy, the netherlands, spain, and switzerland.
A study published on 16 march found that in china, up to 23 january, an estimated 86% of covid-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published 30 march estimated that numbers of infections in italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (r0) for covid-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the us center for disease control and prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with covid-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 april 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to covid-19.
In china, as of 5 february about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.official tallies of deaths from the covid-19 pandemic generally refer to dead people who tested positive for covid according to official protocols.
The number of true fatalities from covid-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official covid death tally by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) acknowledged "we know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the u.s. such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 h1n1 swine flu epidemic.the first confirmed death was in wuhan on 9 january 2020.
The first death outside mainland china occurred on 1 february in the philippines, and the first death outside asia was in france on 14 february.
By 28 february, outside mainland china, more than a dozen deaths each were recorded in iran, south korea, and italy.
By 13 march, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except antarctica.several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.the death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on johns hopkins university statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as of 10 april 2020.
The number varies by region.
In china, estimates for the death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset 1 – 10 january 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 february 2020) .other measures include the case fatality rate (cfr), which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (ifr), which reflects the percent of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The university of oxford's centre for evidence-based medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for covid-19 in germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on cfr estimates.
The who asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej boni of penn state university stated, "left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be ".
The chinese government's senior medical adviser zhong nanshan argued that "it could be over by june" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the who's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 march, adam kucharski of the london school of hygiene & amp; tropical medicine stated that sars-cov-2 "is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two".
According to the imperial college study led by neil ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".
William schaffner of vanderbilt university stated, "i think it's unlikely that this coronavirus — because it's so readily transmissible — will disappear completely" and it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year".
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of covid-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.the who states that approximately one person in six becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.as an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with covid-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that stay for more prolonged periods in the air, that may be generated during speech.respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing out, including when talking, though the virus is not generally airborne.
The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne spread.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns it may spread by faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The government of china denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of sars-cov-2.the virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms suggesting transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.the virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on the humidity and temperature.pets and other animals have tested positive for covid-19.
There is no evidence animals can pass the virus on to humans, though british authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals, like after contact with other surfaces infected people could have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in wuhan.
All features of the novel sars-cov-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.sars-cov-2 is closely related to the original sars-cov.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus betacoronavirus, in subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage b) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (batcov ratg13).
In february 2020, chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Whole-genome comparison to date has found at most 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and sars-cov-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) of infected secretions or ct imaging.
A study comparing pcr to ct in wuhan has suggested that ct is significantly more sensitive than pcr, though less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of march 2020, the american college of radiology recommends that "ct should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose covid-19".
The who has published several rna testing protocols for sars-cov-2, with the first issued on 17 january.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
Generally this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab though a throat swab may also be used.a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 april 2020, none of these has been proved sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the us a serological test developed by cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (ct) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The italian radiological society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by pcr is of limited specificity in identifying covid-19.
A large study in china compared chest ct results to pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect imaging features of the virus with both radiographs and ct.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don't know where or how they were infected.health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with amnesty international and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of april 7, 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19.misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no covid-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The cdc recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
Cdc further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The who advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62 – 71% ethanol, 50 – 100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 – 7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The cdc recommends that if a covid case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and atm machines used by the ill persons, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The who has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to stephen griffin, a virologist at the university of leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the propensity [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene." Masks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease.
The who has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with covid-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the u.s., the cdc recommends wearing non-medical face mask made out of cloth.china has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, particularly when coming into close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth facemasks at home and wash them daily.
The czech republic and slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 march, vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The austrian government mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-march, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on 1 april.
Panama has made it obligatory to wear a face mask whenever going outside, while also recommending the manufacture of a homemade face mask for those who cannot purchase face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in japan, south korea, malaysia, and singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by us government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known covid-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 march 2020, germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the cdc to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.in late march 2020, the who and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with covid-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: Measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.more drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in china once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.simulations for great britain and the united states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2 / 3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medications approved for covid-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medications.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating covid-19.
The who also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" can provide relief of the symptoms caused by sars-cov-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of covid-19 patients is described by the who as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ecdc and the european regional office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may trace back to 1 december 2019 in wuhan, hubei, china.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these kinds of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin.a pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 december and treated by the doctor zhang jixian in hubei provincial hospital, who informed the wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december.

Enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in wuhan to trigger an investigation in early january.during the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-january 2020, the virus spread to other chinese provinces, helped by the chinese new year migration and wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 20 january, china reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in beijing and one in shenzhen.

Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in europe, many countries in the schengen area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdown) and curfews.as of 2 april, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the united states, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the philippines, about 59 million people are in lockdown in south africa, and 1.3 billion people are in lockdown in india.

Mike ryan, executive director of the who's health emergencies program, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready, "urging that the right response measures could help the world avoid" the worst of it ".
Ryan further stated that the current data did not warrant public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 march, the who declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The director-general said that the who was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction" .the who has faced significant criticism for what is seen as inadequate handling of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and the associated sars-cov-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by rt-pcr, which detects the coronavirus' rna.
This test is specific and is designed to only detect the rna of the sars-cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to report or who were asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of march 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
By 23 march, no country had tested more than 3% of their population, and there are massive variations in how much testing has been done across countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The rt-pcr test performed with throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later on the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively sample material can then be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or coughing up material (sputum) can be used.
One of the early pcr tests was developed at charité in berlin in january 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the world health organization (who).
The united kingdom had also developed a test by 23 january 2020.the south korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, pcr-based sars-cov-2 detection kit (powerchek coronavirus) on 28 january 2020.
It looks for the "e" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the rdrp gene specific to sars-cov-2.in china, bgi group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from china's national medical products administration for a pcr-based sars-cov-2 detection kit.in the united states, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) real-time rt-pcr diagnostic panel to public health labs through the international reagent resource.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a bottleneck of testing at the cdc in atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout the whole of february 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 february 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing.
The test was approved by the food and drug administration under an emergency use authorization.us commercial labs began testing in early march 2020.
As of 5 march 2020 labcorp announced nationwide availability of covid-19 testing based on rt-pcr.
Quest diagnostics similarly made nationwide covid-19 testing available as of 9 march 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; specimen collection and processing must be performed according to cdc requirements.
In russia, the covid-19 test was developed and produced by the state research center of virology and biotechnology vector.
On 11 february 2020 the test was registered by the federal service for surveillance in healthcare.on 12 march 2020, mayo clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect covid-19 infection.on 13 march 2020, roche diagnostics received fda approval for a test which could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, thus allowing one machine to do approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 march 2020, the fda issued emergency use authorization (eua) to abbott laboratories for a test on abbott's m2000 system; the fda had previously issued similar authorization to hologic, labcorp, and thermo fisher scientific.
On 21 march 2020, cepheid similarly received eua from the fda for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The fda has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of pcr.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the u.s. and abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.a test which uses a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (n protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid influenza test.
A march 2020 literature review concluded that "chest radiographs are of little diagnostic value in early stages, whereas ct [computed tomography] findings may be present even before symptom onset."
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it.
It originates from the bible passage in matthew where pontius pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify jesus christ, but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some english communities.
In shakespeare's macbeth, lady macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including bahá'í faith, hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in judaism, lavabo in christianity, and wudhu in islam.religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, judaism and islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet.
And, hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism and islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.
Workplace hazard controls for covid-19
Workplace hazard controls for covid-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting covid-19.
According to the u.s. occupational safety and health administration (osha), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with covid-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with covid-19 is encountered.
Osha considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with covid-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with covid-19.
Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
Covid-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick, needing to care for others, or from fear of possible exposure.
Patterns of commerce may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by covid-19 may be interrupted.an infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where covid-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (ppe) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of ppe must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the u.s. occupational safety and health administration (osha), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed, discouraging workers from using others' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
The u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are to stay home until they are free of fever, signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines, and that sick leave policies are flexible, permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to osha, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected covid-19 patients, but may be infected with sars-cov-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual has recent international travel to a location with widespread covid-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.engineering controls for this and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing a drive-through window for customer service.administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing staggered shifts, discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing covid-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans including a forum for answering workers ’ concerns, providing workers with up-to-date education and training on covid-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to use it, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting customers' and the public's access to the worksite, and posting signage about hand washing and other covid-19 protective measures.depending on the work task, workers with at least medium exposure risk may need to wear personal protective equipment including some combination of gloves, a gown, a face shield or face mask, or goggles.
Workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.for commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.for schools and childcare facilities, cdc recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.for law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by cdc.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have covid-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used ppe and for containing and laundering clothes.
Osha considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected covid-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected covid-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection.
High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of covid-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected covid-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The world health organization (who) recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected covid-19 case.in addition to other ppe, osha recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected with sars-cov-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the united states, niosh-approved n95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.the who does not recommend coveralls, as covid-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
Who recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.
For those who are collecting respiratory specimens from, caring for, or transporting covid-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, who recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an n95 or ffp2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of ppe is insufficient, who recommends minimizing the need for ppe through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a covid-19 patient, using only the ppe necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the ppe supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

We find ourselves in remarkable circumstances this month.
The covid-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another.
We don ’ t have precedent for its challenges, but we do know that our best response relies on the sort of global empathy, cooperation, and community building that sits at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and care we have seen among all of our colleagues over email, calls, and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with.
I couldn ’ t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites stay up or our colleagues paid or our communities safe.
The world needs the information that wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together, starting this coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As robyn mentioned previously, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we ’ re facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
Overwhelmingly we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to dial back, that ’ s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We ’ re not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we ’ re saying it.
No sick days or pto required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for covid-19, please let bryan within t & amp; c ops know so t & amp; c can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management).
Hourly folks will be fully paid.
We have already said, and are recommitting to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours worked during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially during times like this.
Again, this is about your self-care.
The covid-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2).
The virus was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan, china.
The world health organization declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 march 2020.
As of 24 june 2021, more than 179 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.89 million confirmed deaths attributed to covid-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.
The severity of covid-19 symptoms is highly variable, ranging from unnoticeable to life-threatening.
Severe illness is more likely in elderly covid-19 patients, as well as those who have underlying medical conditions.
Covid-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles.
The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors.
Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces.
People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.
Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.
Several vaccines have been developed and widely distributed in most developed countries since december 2020.
Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop medications that inhibit the virus.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns and quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business closures.
Numerous jurisdictions have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the great depression of the 1930s.
It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, and food shortages.
However, there have also been decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed.
Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions have been exacerbated.
The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.
Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak started in wuhan, hubei, china in late 2019.
Many early cases of covid-19 were linked to people who had visited the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan, but it is possible that human-to-human transmission was already happening before this.
On 11 february 2020, the world health organization (who) named the disease "covid-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and sars-cov.
The current scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal.
Despite this, the subject has generated a significant amount of speculation and conspiracy theories, which were amplified by rapidly growing online echo chambers.
Global geopolitical divisions, notably between the united states and china, have been heightened because of this issue.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 december 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 november.
Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected with the virus between mid-october and mid-november 2019.
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for covid-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.
An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86 per cent of covid-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 per cent of documented cases.
Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.
On 9 april 2020, preliminary results found that 15 per cent of people tested in gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in germany, tested positive for antibodies.
Screening for covid-19 in pregnant women in new york city, and blood donors in the netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.
Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.
Some results (such as the gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.
An analysis in early 2020 of cases by age in china indicated that a relatively low proportion of cases occurred in individuals under 20.
It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.
A retrospective cohort study in china found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (r0) for covid-19 in january were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 per cent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).
R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called r), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.
By mid-may 2020, the effective r was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.
Official deaths from covid-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.
These counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.
Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.
Comparisons of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicate excess mortality in many countries.
This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.
The first confirmed death was in wuhan on 9 january 2020.
The first reported death outside of china occurred on 1 february in the philippines, and the first reported death outside asia was in the united states on 6 february.
More than 95 per cent of the people who contract covid-19 recover.
Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.
As of 24 june 2021, more than 3.89 million deaths have been attributed to covid-19.
People at the greatest risk of mortality from covid-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as those with a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).
Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.
Countries like belgium include deaths from suspected cases of covid-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to covid-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on johns hopkins university statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.2 percent (3,890,437 deaths for 179,541,481 cases) as of 24 june 2021.
The number varies by region
The official death counts have been criticised for underreporting the actual death toll, because comparisons of death rates before and during the pandemic show an increase in deaths that is not explained by covid-19 deaths alone.
Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from covid-19 worldwide have included a range from 7 to 13 million by the economist, as well as over 9 million by the institute for health metrics and evaluation.
On 24 march 2020, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) of the united states, indicated the who had provided two codes for covid-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and u07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.
The cdc noted that "because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the u.s., [the national center for health statistics (nchs)] is not planning to implement u07.2 for mortality statistics" and that u07.1 would be used "if the death certificate reports terms such as' probable covid-19 'or' likely covid-19 '."
The cdc also noted "it is not likely that nchs will follow up on these cases" and while the "underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate,...
The rules for coding and selection of the... cause of death are expected to result in covid – 19 being the underlying cause more often than not. "
On 16 april 2020, the who, in its formal publication of the two codes, u07.1 and u07.2, "recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code covid-19 provisionally to code u07.1 unless it is stated as' probable 'or' suspected '."
It was also noted that the who "does not distinguish" between infection by sars-cov-2 and covid-19.
A crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (ifr), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.
Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).
Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'.
In november 2020, a review article in nature reported estimates of population-weighted ifrs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.
In december 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the european journal of epidemiology estimated that population-weighted ifr was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (france, netherlands, new zealand, and portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and about 2.5% in italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.
This study also found that most of the differences in ifr across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low ifrs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher ifrs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).
These results were also highlighted in a december 2020 report issued by the world health organization.
An analysis of those ifr rates indicates that covid-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom a fatal covid-19 infection is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza
Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (cfr), [a] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.
This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).
On 4 august 2020, who indicated "at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of cfr by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%."
Symptoms of covid-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.
People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time.
Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: One respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.
In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with covid-19.
Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms and can get amnesia after recovery (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).
At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.
These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.
Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms.
The median delay for covid-19 is four to five days.
Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.
Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease.
However, some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery — named long covid — and damage to organs has been observed.
Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and particles that infected people release as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.
Infected people are more likely to transmit covid-19 the when they are physically close.
However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.
Infectivity begins as early as three days before symptoms appear, and people are most infectious just prior to and during the onset of symptoms.
It declines after the first week, but infected people remain contagious for up to 20 days.
People can spread the disease even if they are asymptomatic.
Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne or fall to the ground.
Various groups utilise terms such as "airborne" and "droplet" both in technical and general ways, leading to confusion around terminology.
Additionally, covid-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses transmit.
The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.
Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close, but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated; in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.
The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; with only 10 to 20% of people responsible for the diseases spread.
It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.
Often in these cases, superspreading events occur, where many people are infected by one person.
Sars ‑ cov ‑ 2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
It is a positive-sense single-stranded rna (+ ssrna) virus, with a single linear rna segment.
Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, and avian species, including livestock and companion animals.
Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers, fatality rate ~ 34%).
Sars-cov-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, mers-cov, and the original sars-cov.
Viral genetic sequence data can provide critical information about whether viruses separated by time and space are likely to be epidemiologically linked.
With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
By 12 january 2020, five genomes of sars ‑ cov ‑ 2 had been isolated from wuhan and reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention (ccdc) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 january 2020.
A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were "highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor", implying that the first human infection occurred in november or december 2019.
Examination of the topology of the phylogenetic tree at the start of the pandemic also found high similarities between human isolates.
As of 7 may 2020, 4,690 sars ‑ cov ‑ 2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.
The standard methods of testing for presence of sars-cov-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral rna fragments.
As these tests detect rna but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited." The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within hours.
The who has published several testing protocols for the disease.
Chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (ct) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Those diagnosed with covid-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the cdc to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.
In phase iii trials, several covid ‑ 19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic covid ‑ 19 infections.
As of june 2021, 18 vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: Two rna vaccines (pfizer – biontech and moderna), nine conventional inactivated vaccines (bbibp-corv, chinese academy of medical sciences, coronavac, covaxin, covivac, coviran barakat, minhai-kangtai, qazvac, and wibp-corv), five viral vector vaccines (sputnik light, sputnik v, oxford – astrazeneca, convidecia, and johnson & johnson), and two protein subunit vaccines (epivaccorona and rbd-dimer).
In total, as of march 2021, 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in phase i trials, 33 in phase i – ii trials, and 16 in phase iii development.
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.
Single dose interim use is under consideration to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improves.
On 21 december 2020, the european union approved the pfizer biontech vaccine.
Vaccinations began to be administered on 27 december 2020.
The moderna vaccine was authorised on 6 january 2021 and the astrazeneca vaccine was authorised on 29 january 2021.
On 4 february 2020, us secretary of health and human services alex azar published a notice of declaration under the public readiness and emergency preparedness act for medical countermeasures against covid-19, covering "any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate covid-19, or the transmission of sars-cov-2 or a virus mutating therefrom", and stating that the declaration precludes "liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct".
The declaration is effective in the united states through 1 october 2024.
On 8 december it was reported that the astrazeneca vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a study.
By mid-june 2021, 85 percent of vaccinations have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries.
Only 0.3 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.
There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 virus.
Thus, the cornerstone of management of covid-19 is supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.
A critically ill patient receiving invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit of the heart institute, university of são paulo.
Due to a shortage of mechanical ventilators, a bridge ventilator is being used to automatically actuate a bag valve mask.
Most cases of covid-19 are mild.
In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.
Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.
The u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.
People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital.
In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.
Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials.
Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.
Despite ongoing research, there is still not enough high-quality evidence to recommend so-called early treatment.
Nevertheless, in the united states, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease.
The antiviral remdesivir is available in the u.s., canada, australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the world health organization (who), due to limited evidence of its efficacy.
Several variants of sars-cov-2 have emerged that are spreading globally.
The most currently prevalent, all of which share the more infectious d614g mutation, are:
B.1.1.7, first detected in the uk, which has spread to over 120 countries
P.1, first detected in brazil, which has spread to more than 50 countries
B.1.351, first detected in south africa, which has spread to over 80 countries
The severity of covid-19 varies.
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
In 3 – 4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.
The italian istituto superiore di sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised.
However, people transferred to an icu had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.
Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated c-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of covid-19 and with a transfer to icu.
Speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the fat-tailed nature of pandemic risk and the exponential growth of covid-19 infections.
For mitigation to be effective, (a) chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health care must be available to provide for the needs of those infected, and (c) contingencies must be in place to allow for effective rollout of (a) and (b).
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.
Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the infection.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.
When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: Measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.
Some measures, particularly those that focus on cleaning surfaces rather than preventing airborne transmission, have been criticised as hygiene theatre.
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in china once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.
Simulations for great britain and the united states show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with amnesty international and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 april 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
(Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)
On 10 april 2020, google and apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on bluetooth technology and cryptography.
The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the ios and android mobile platforms.
In europe and in the u.s., palantir technologies is also providing covid-19 tracking services.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of covid-19 patients is described by the who as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ecdc and the european regional office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards covid-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating covid-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3d printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.
On 23 april 2020, nasa reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing.
Nasa is seeking fast-track approval.
Individuals and groups of makers around the world also assisted in the efforts by creating and sharing open source designs, and manufacturing devices using locally sourced materials, sewing, and 3d printing.
Millions of face shields, protective gowns, and masks were made.
Other medical supplies were made such as shoes covers, surgical caps, powered air-purifying respirators, and hand sanitizer.
Novel devices were created such as ear savers, non-invasive ventilation helmets, and ventilator splitters.

National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).
The who's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted.
To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the long-term responses to the pandemic should consist of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.

The covid-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural and food systems worldwide.
Covid-19 hit at a time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.
Based on the latest un estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.
This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices.
In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production.
As a result, several famines are forecast, which the un called a crisis "of biblical proportions," or "hunger pandemic." It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with oxfam reporting that "12,000 people per day could die from covid-19 linked hunger" by the end of 2020.

The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous positive effects to the environment and climate.
The global reduction in modern human activity such as the considerable decline in planned travel was coined anthropause and has caused a large drop in air pollution and water pollution in many regions.
In china, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions and 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, which one earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.
Other positive effects on the environment include governance-system-controlled investments towards a sustainable energy transition and other goals related to environmental protection such as the european union's seven-year €1 trillion budget proposal and €750 billion recovery plan "next generation eu" which seeks to reserve 25% of eu spending for climate-friendly expenditure.

Age-based discrimination against older adults, while already present before the pandemic, was more prevalent during the pandemic.

It was confirmed that at least three quarters of the hse's it servers had been decrypted and 70% of computer devices were back in use, following the cyber attack in may.
Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.
They prepare your immune system (the body's natural defence) to recognize a particular virus and protect against that virus.
The janssen vaccine is also known as the 'johnson & johnson vaccine'.
This vaccine is produced by johnson & johnson.
This vaccine is given as an injection into the upper arm.
It only takes a few minutes.
Doses
Only one dose of the janssen covid-19 vaccine is required for long-term protection.
The vaccine takes full effect after 14 days.
You will then be fully vaccinated.
Immunity
Vaccines enable your immune system to protect you from disease.
It would be best if your immune system could protect you with the vaccine instead of getting covid-19.
Safety
The janssen covid-19 vaccine was developed according to international safety standards.
The vaccine has been tested on thousands of people during clinical trials
Side effects
Vaccines, like all other medicines, can have side effects.
Most of these are mild or moderate and do not last long.
Not everyone gets side effects.
Getting your vaccine
Most people will be given the vaccine at a gp surgery or vaccination center.
You are getting your vaccine - more information here.
The best vaccine
All vaccines are tested for safety and efficacy before use.
The hse only uses a vaccine if it meets the required safety and efficacy standards.
You should take whatever covid-19 vaccine is offered to you.
Find out more about the development of covid-19 vaccines
If you are pregnant
The cossid-19 janssen vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.
You will be offered another vaccine.
Talk to your gp or obstetrician about getting your covid-19 vaccine.
Find out more about covid-19 vaccines during pregnancy
If you are feeding your child yourself
You can get the covid-10 vaccine if you are feeding your baby yourself.
The covid-19 vaccine will not be given to your baby.

If you are aged between 56 and 69, you can register now to receive your covid-19 vaccine.
Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.
They prepare your immune system (the body's natural defence) to recognize a particular virus and protect against that virus.
The astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine is effective for any age group.
If you have been vaccinated, you will be protected against covid-19.
The risk of illness if you get covid-19 far outweighs any risk associated with the vaccine.
Astrazeneca is not recommended for people under 60 years of age due to an abnormal risk of low platelet blood clots after receiving the vaccine.
It is a precaution because people under 60 are less likely to get a severe covid-19 illness and other vaccines are available.
Learn more about uncommon side effects and the new guide
Doses
You will need two doses of the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine.
You will receive the second dose 12 weeks after the first dose if
You are 60 years of age or older
You have a health condition that puts you at high or very high risk from covid-19
If you are under 60 and do not have a health condition that puts you at high or very high risk from covid-19, you should wait 16 weeks to receive a second dose.
This has increased from 12 weeks.
This extra time allows us to do more research as more evidence becomes available.
Vaccine 'bonus'
28 days after your first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine, you can follow the same 'vaccine bonus' public health advice as people who have been fully vaccinated.
This does not include travel abroad.
You still need to get your second dose to make sure your vaccine protection lasts.
Read government advice on the vaccine bonus

If you are pregnant or nursing your child yourself
If you have not yet been vaccinated, you will be offered a covid-19 vaccine other than astrazeneca.
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding and have received your first dose of the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine, wait at least 12 weeks before receiving the second dose.
You will be at greater risk of serious illness if you do not receive your second dose.
The benefits outweigh the harms of getting a vaccine.
Getting two vaccines will reduce your chances of becoming very ill because of covid-19.
For adults, self-isolation means staying inside and staying away from others altogether.
But there is other advice for children.
Children cannot be asked to self-isolate on their own, especially if they are very young.
An adult will need to care for a child and help the child reduce the risk of the virus spreading.
The child and adult should stay away from others, especially those who live with them.
Choose one carer to care for the child.
One person should take care of the child when self-isolating.
That person must be in good health.
One should not choose to:
They have a long-term illness
They have a weak immune system
Over 70 years old
People in these groups are at high risk from covid-19
When should your child stay away from others
Your child must be kept out of others if:
They have a temperature of 38 degrees celsius or higher
They get a new cough
There is a change in taste or smell
Are breathlessness them
They already have a worsening breathing condition - asthma, for example
Call your gp.
Your child may need a covid-19 (coronavirus) test.
Read advice for self-isolated people
Your child does not have to isolate:
If they have had direct contact with a covid-19 case that is confirmed but has no symptoms on the plate
If the child is living with someone who is ill and may be infected with the virus.
But in these situations, they will have to restrict their movements.
The difference between isolation and restriction of movements
Self-isolation and restricting movements are two different things.
In both cases, the child should not go to school or childcare.
Everyone who lives with the child should stay home.
Your child or the people living with them may have been asked to restrict their movements.
It means that they should stay at home and stay away from the others in the household.
Read more about the difríoctaí between self-isolation and restrict your movement is
Everyone in the household should restrict their movements
Your child may need help with daily activities such as washing, eating or going to the toilet.
As a result, everyone should take extra care to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.
You and everyone in the household must restrict your movements for 17 days.
This includes the ten days your child will be isolated and seven days later.
As everyone in the household is close contact, everyone must be tested for covid-19.
How long your child should stay away from others
If your child has to isolate, they will have to stay isolated until they receive test results.
If the test is positive, your child will need to continue to isolate until both of the following conditions apply:
Has not had a high temperature (38 degrees celsius or more) for 5 days
That 10 days have elapsed since the symptoms occurred
If your child has no signs of illness but has been tested because they were a close contact, isolation can be stopped ten days from the day they were tested.
Read here about what to do if your child has a negative test result.
If anyone else in the house gets symptoms or becomes ill
If anyone else in the household becomes sick, self-isolated and call the gp.
There is specific advice for adults and children over the age of 13 on self-isolation.
You may need a covid-19 test and treat your symptoms at home
You can get a free covid-19 trial at a walk-in test centre if you have no symptoms.
You do not need a gp appointment or referral.
If you have covid-19 symptoms, do not go to a walk-in centre.
Stay alone (stay in your room) and call a gp immediately.
Who can use the walk-in service
You can use the covid-19 walk-in test service if you do not have covid-19 signs and:
If you are aged 16 or over
If you live in an area where there is a walk-in test centre
If you have not tested positive for covid-19 in the last six months
Each test will be one test.
Talk to your gp if you think you need another test.
What you need to bring with you
You must bring a photo id and a mobile phone number.
Venues, dates and times
Do not come to a test centre before opening time.
Test centres are bustling, and you may have to wait.
If you come close to closing time and there is a queue, chances are you will not be tested that day.

Sources are explored when trying to find out how or when someone first contracted covid-19 (coronavirus).
A person, place or event can be a source of infection.
An investigation of the source gives us information about sites and cases where covid-19 is disseminated.
It helps us identify and prevent the developing covid-19 clusters in the community.
The difference between source exploration and contact tracking
Contact tracking
People who have been in close contact with a person with covid-19 are identified.
During contact tracing, the timeline, in that case, will depend on whether they had symptoms of illness when tested for covid-19.
Read about contact tracking
Exploration of sources
The investigation will find a citation:
A case in which a person may become infected
Who may infect them
We will ask people with covid-19 if they have been in contact with someone who has covid-19.
If not, we will ask them about events or places they were in the week before they became ill.
If they did not show signs of illness, we would ask them about events they attended or where they were tested the week before for covid-19.
The source of infection can be traced that way.
Other infections from the same source may stop.
People in the same place or at the same event that the person with covid-19 attended could be contacted.
If you have received a text message
If you have received a text message from the source audit team, a free covid-19 test will be arranged for you.
You will be sent a text message with details of your test appointment.
If you do not have covid-19 symptoms, you do not need to restrict your movements (stay at home).
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate (stay in your room) and call your gp immediately.
If you are pregnant, you should get your covid-19 vaccine when it is offered to you.
It reduces the chances of you getting sick.
It may also reduce the chances of you having complications during pregnancy, such as giving birth prematurely.
That could happen if you are very ill with covid-19. (Coronavirus).
Covid-19 vaccines are new vaccines.
We are still learning about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy and when a mother is breastfeeding.
The vaccines have not been tested on pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Our knowledge to date shows that the astrazeneca, moderna and pfizer / biontech vaccines have no adverse effects on unborn babies.
They are not live vaccines, so neither the mother nor the baby can be infected with covid-19.
Vaccines break down quickly in the body and cannot be part of the dna of the mother or baby.
All covid-19 vaccines can be given to women who are breastfeeding.
They have no effect on children on the breast.
Read about the first groups to get the covid-19 vaccine
Covid-19 vaccine doses
When you receive your covid-19 vaccine, you will need two doses.
You should receive the first dose at or after 14 weeks of pregnancy.
You should receive a second dose before the end of 36 weeks of pregnancy.
If you are not given a second dose by the end of 36 weeks, it should be postponed until you have your baby.
This is recommended because you may get a fever after the second dose.
Find out more about your covid-19 vaccine
Side effects
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.
Most are mild or moderate and short-term.
Not everyone gets side effects.
Read about side effects after covid-19 vaccines
Pregnant women are at high risk
You should talk to your obstetrician or gp about getting your covid-19 vaccine if:
You are a pregnant healthcare worker
You are at greater risk from covid-19
Pregnant after your covid-19 vaccine
You do not need to leave any gap between having your covid-19 vaccine and getting pregnant.
If you become pregnant after receiving the first dose
If you become pregnant after receiving the first dose of your covid-19 vaccine, you should wait 14 weeks or later to receive the second dose.
Don't worry if you get your vaccine before you know you are pregnant.
To be careful, you should wait 14 weeks or later to get your vaccine.
This is recommended to avoid any possible link between the vaccine and miscarriage.
Other vaccines during pregnancy
You will need other vaccines during pregnancy.
These are:
Pertussis vaccine
Flu vaccine - if you are pregnant during the flu season from october to the end of april
Leave a 14-day gap between your covid-19 vaccination and any other vaccine.
Read more about vaccines needed during pregnancy
Fertility treatment
There is no evidence that covid-19 vaccination affects fertility.
You do not have to leave any gap after receiving your covid-19 vaccine and your fertility treatment such as ivf.
But you may want to wait until you are fully vaccinated before attempting to conceive or undergo fertility treatment.
This is recommended because you may get a fever in the 48 hours after receiving your vaccine, especially the second dose.
Breastfeeding after your covid-19 vaccine
If you are breastfeeding, you should get your covid-19 vaccine when it is offered to you.
You can breastfeed your baby after your vaccination.
The covid-19 vaccines have not been tested on breastfeeding women.
But there is no known reason to avoid breastfeeding if you have been vaccinated.
If very small portions of vaccine enter your breast milk, they will be digested in your baby's stomach.
Your vaccine breaks down quickly in your body and cannot be part of your child's dna.
Your baby cannot be infected with covid-19 in this way.
If you have been vaccinated while pregnant, your breast milk may contain antibodies against covid-19 and may give the baby some protection.
This advice is for infants and children of primary and secondary school age - usually 18 years old.
If your child has symptoms of covid-19 (coronavirus) or has had close contact with someone with covid-19, do not let them go to school or attend childcare.
Covid-19 testing may be required
Read more about when your child should be kept home from school.
When is it ok to let your child attend school or childcare?
If he / she is not a close contact, it is usually ok to let a child go to school:
If they have only one nasal symptom, such as a runny or sneezing nose
If they do not have a high temperature, as long as their temperature has not been lowered by taking any form of paracetamol or ibuprofen - this can hide a high temperature
Unless they have a new cough
If they do not live with anyone who is ill and may have covid-19
If a gp has said that their illness is caused by something else, it is not covid-19.
Your gp will tell you when they can return to school or attend childcare after an illness.
The child tested negative for the covid-19 test, and the child had no symptoms of illness for 48 hours.
If the child has not had diarrhoea for 48 hours
If they are being tested as part of a series testing program and are not showing signs of illness and are not a close contact.
For example, some children live indirect supply centres
If the child is regularly tested as a member of a vulnerable group.
A gp certificate is not required.
You do not need a gp certificate or gp note to return to school.
The school may ask you to sign a form confirming that your child is fit to attend.
Thorny or sneezing nose
It's okay to take your child to school or childcare if they have symptoms of a runny nose or sneezing.
A runny nose or sneezing alone is more likely to be a sign of a cold or other viral infection.
But if they have a high temperature (38 degrees celsius or higher); lost smell or taste; cough; or shortness of breath:
Separate your child from others
Call your gp
Restrict your movements
Most of the time, you do not need to call your gp if your child has symptoms of a runny nose or sneezing.
It is best to talk to your pharmacist.
Teach the child to sneeze and cough in their elbow.
Have them also use a paper towel to clean their nose and throw it in the bin after use.
Covid-19 (coronavirus) is spread by sneezing or coughing.
It must pass from the nose or mouth of an infected person into your eyes, nose or mouth to get the virus.
This can happen if someone with the virus coughs or sneezes near you or touches an object or surface they have come in contact with them.
It is essential to:
Wash your hands often and adequately
Practice social separation
Covers coughs and sneezes
Follow government guidance on restrictions
Follow the advice on this page as much as possible and encourage others to do the same.
People at greater risk from covid-19
Covid-19 can cause serious illness to anyone.
For some people, the risk is more significant.
People who are at greater risk from covid-19 should be more careful.
Read advice for people who are more at risk from the virus
Wash your hands
Proper and frequent handwashing will help prevent the spread of covid-19.
Use soap and water or a hand sanitiser with alcohol to clean your hands:
After coughing or sneezing
If you have been in contact with someone who has a fever or respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing)
Before and after you are on public transport, if you have to use it
Before and after being in a crowd (especially an indoor crowd)
When you enter and leave buildings, your own home or anyone else ’ s house
Before you smoke a cigarette or a cigarette
Even if you don ’ t see dirt on your hands
After using the toilet
Take care of your hands.
Apply moisturizer often.
Any product will make a reason, a basic one without perfume or colour.
Read about how to clean your hands properly
Facial covers
Wear face cover on public transport, in shops and all indoor locations.
That's the law.
You could be fined or refused entry if you do not wear one.
You should also wear face cover in crowded workplaces, places of worship and outdoor spaces where many people gather.
Read more about face masks, medical masks and disposable gloves
Sneezes and coughs
When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a paper towel or sleeve.
Put the handkerchief in the bin and wash your hands.
Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless they are clean.
By some things
Do not share items that come in contact with your mouth, for example, bottles or cups.
Clean and disinfect all surfaces and handles frequently.
Social separation
Social separation is important to delay the spread of covid-19 by keeping infected people and healthy people apart.
This will reduce the contact between infected and healthy people.
You should:
Stay 2 meters (6 feet) away from others,
Avoid shared sleeping areas,
Avoid crowded places,
Do not shake hands or make close contact with others, if possible
There is little danger if you are passing someone.
But try to stay 2 meters away as much as possible.
When you can't wait for 2 meters from others
Try to stay clear of places that do not allow you to stay 2 meters away from others.
If you are in a public place where it is too difficult to wait for 2 meters from others, you should wear a face cover.
Meeting others
At level 5, no visitor to your home is allowed except:
If there is an essential family cause
People in your support bulbs
Support bulbs
People living alone or with one parent can pair with one other family for support.
These are called 'support bulbs'.
The people in your 'support bulb' can be visited, and they can visit you.
You can meet outside and elsewhere.
Read more about the support bulbs on gov.ie
If visitors can come to your home
If the current restrictions allow you, visitors, tell them to wash their hands when they enter.
When they disappear, clean all surfaces they have been in contact with them.
Use for routine household cleaning and disinfectants.
Do not wear disposable gloves instead of cleaning your hands.
The virus affects them the same way it gets on your hands.
Corruption can get on the hands when you remove them.
Wear face coverage when visiting people who are 70 years of age or older or people who are at greater risk from covid-19.
When to meet others
Do not visit others if:
You have any sign of covid-19
If the contact trackers have told you that you are a close contact
Check with people in advance before you visit that they have no symptoms and are feeling well.
Read advice on those at greater risk
Travel
Avoid public transport.
Walk or cycle instead of using public transport, if possible.
Read about the current restrictions on public transport or inland travel
Do not share vehicles with people who are not members of your household.
If you do, wear a face cover
Work
Do your work from home if possible.
Only essential workers should be going to workplaces.
Face covers are recommended in crowded workplaces.
Read more about the current restrictions on work on gov.ie
Social separation at work
Follow the advice on social segregation everywhere outside your home, including your workplace.
Get advice
Contact the health and safety authority (hsa) by email wcu @ hsa.ie:
You are concerned about the implementation of social segregation measures in the workplace
If you are the employer and need advice on preventing covid-19 in the workplace
If you are returning to work, read information about returning to work safely.
Use the covid tracker
The covid tracker is a free and easy to use app and:
Will send you an immediate contact alert if someone you have had close contact with gets a positive result for covid -19
It will give you advice on how to protect yourself and others
It will alert other users of the app you contacted directly if you get a positive result for covid-19
The app is part of our contact tracking.
Contact tracking is very important to prevent the spread of covid-19.
The more people who find and use the app, the better the contact tracking.
If you are aged between 65 and 69, you can register now to receive your covid-19 vaccine.
A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.
They prepare your immune system (your body's natural defence) to recognize and fight a particular virus.
All vaccines do this.
Different vaccines work in different ways.
Some vaccines contain a live virus.
Some types of the vaccine contain live virus.
For example, the flu vaccine contains a small amount of the flu virus.
But none of the covid-19 vaccines in use contains the covid-19 virus.
They work differently.
There are two types of covid-19 vaccine in use:
Mrna
Viral vector
Mrna vaccines
The pfizer / biontech covid-19 vaccine and the moderna covid-19 vaccine are mrna vaccines.
Mrna vaccines enable your body to make the protein that stimulates an immune response without using a live virus.
After receiving an mrna vaccine, your body produces antibodies that help you fight infection if a virus enters your body in the future.
Researchers have been studying and working with mrna vaccines for years
How covid-19 mrna vaccines work
The surface of the covid-19 virus is intertwined with proteins known as “spike proteins ”.
The virus uses these spikes to enter human cells, giving you a covid-19 infection.
The instructions for making this spice protein are contained in the covid-19 mrna vaccines.
When you get the vaccine, your immune system recognizes that the protein is not involved.
Then your body starts the immune response to fight against what it thinks is an infection.
This immune response makes antibodies.
The antibodies protect you against covid-19.
It is much safer for the immune system to learn how to protect you from covid-19 by getting vaccinated instead of getting the virus.
Your cells then break down the instructions on making the spice protein and expel them from your body.
Viral vector vaccines
The astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine.
Virus viral vaccines use another harmless virus as a delivery system.
This vaccine allows your body to make the protein that stimulates an immune response.
Hundreds of scientific studies on viral vector vaccines have been conducted and published worldwide.
Several recently used vaccines for ebola outbreaks have used the viral vector technology.
Other studies have focused on a viral vector vaccine against zika, influenza and hiv.
How covid-19 viral vector vaccines work
Viral vector vaccines are like messengers.
They use a weakened version of another virus (the vector) to guide the cells in your body,
Covid-19 vaccines use the adenovirus as a vector.
Adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold.
The surface of the covid-19 virus is intertwined with proteins known as “spike proteins ”.
The virus uses these spikes to enter human cells, giving you a covid-19 infection.
When you receive a viral vector vaccine, the vector (adenovirus) enters a cell in your body.
It teaches the cell how to produce covid-19 spice protein.
After receiving the vaccine, your immune system recognizes that the protein is not involved.
Then your body starts the immune response to fight against what it thinks is an infection.
This immune response makes antibodies.
The antibodies protect you against covid-19.
It is much safer for the immune system to learn how to protect you from covid-19 by getting vaccinated instead of getting the virus.
This topic has been examined by vaccine experts working in ireland.
Covid tracker app
Why use the covid tracker app?
If you receive a call alert
Using the covid tracking app if you get a positive result on your test
Tracking your signals
The technology used by the covid tracker app
Privacy and how we use your data
The covid tracker app is part of our contact tracking campaign.
It uses a technology developed by apple and google called the disclosure notification system (ens).
Ens is free and is available on almost all mobile phones under 5 years of age.
You need to update your phone's operating system to make sure it has ens.
Ens uses bluetooth and randomly generated ids to log anonymously on:
Any mobile phone with which you have direct contact and which has the app.
The distance between your mobile phone and another app user's mobile phone
The length of time your cell phone stays next to another app user's cell phone
It does not track where you are or use that information.
The app will never know where you were or who was with you.
The app works with other similar apps used by other health services such as northern ireland, germany, italy, denmark, spain, hungary and latvia.
How the app works
The app downloads a list of random ids every 2 hours.
These ids are shared anonymously with app users who tested positive for covid-19 (coronavirus).
If you have been within 2 meters of anyone for more than 15 minutes, you will receive an alert that you are a close contact.
The app does this work in the background.
This means you can use your mobile phone as usual.
Bluetooth
The bluetooth on your mobile phone must be turned on in order for the contact tracking system to function.
You will be asked to give the app your permission to use the ens once you start using the app.
This will also turn on bluetooth.
The app uses low energy bluetooth (le) to estimate the distance and time between app users.
It would be able to tell you precisely if you spent 15 minutes or more near someone who tested positive for the virus.
It will tell exactly how far you were from the other app user most of the time.
But this or any other tracking method is not entirely accurate.
That's why we use 2 contact tracking methods - the contact tracking team and the covid tracker app.
Random identities
Ens enables mobile phones to share random ids using bluetooth.
These ids contain information about how far you have been from another app user and how much time you have spent near it.
These codes are letters and numbers.
You never see them.
They cannot be used to identify users or their cell phones.
By using random identifications, all information is collected anonymously.
No one, even the hse, will know your details unless you choose to share them.
Use of mobile data
The app uses around 1mb of data per day.
This is the same amount of data you would use if you were browsing the internet for 6 minutes.
Battery life
Using the app should not make any difference to the battery life of your mobile phone.
The app uses low energy bluetooth.
This is the same technology used in smart watches or wireless headphones.
It is designed to be energy efficient.

Privacy and how we use your data
Covid tracking app
If you test positive for your covid-19 (coronavirus detected) test, you can use the app to share your close contacts with the contact tracking team.
This is done anonymously using random ids.
You will not know any details relating to your immediate contacts and will not know your own details.
Sharing your direct contacts via the app ensures that those you have been in close contact with are alerted.
This speeds up contact tracking.
It ’ s up to you if you want to do this.
Get an upload code
The contact tracking team will call you and ask for your contact details.
You will also be asked if you are using the app.
If you have the app, you will be sent a unique text upload code.
This code allows you to upload your direct contacts anonymously.
Upload codes are issued only by members of the contact tracking team.
Uploading your contacts
When you receive the upload code:
Open the app
Click on the 'contact tracker' icon at the bottom of the app
Scroll down and click on 'upload your random ids
Enter your unique code (you can copy and paste this from text)
The random ids collected by your phone in the last 14 days will be uploaded.
These ids tell how close you were to other users of the app and how close you were to them.
Your privacy is protected
Your random ids are anonymous and protect your privacy when you upload them.
No one will know your personal details unless they share them with you, including the hse.
No one will know:
Your name
Who met you or was in close contact with you.
The places you were
Who tested positive for covid-19 (virus detected)
Privacy and how we use your data
Privacy and data security are vital to the hse.
The covid tracking app protects the privacy of everyone who uses the app.
Protecting your privacy
An aip:
The app does not collect your name, age or address
It only keeps your phone number if you choose to share it
It cannot be used to track where you are
It cannot be used to check whether you should be self-isolating
It can only access information on the phone of your choice
It cannot be used to identify your immediate contacts
It cannot be used to identify people who have tested positive for covid-19 (coronavirus)
You choose the data you share
It's always your choice:
Using or not using the app
Sharing data and information with or without us
You can:
Change your preference at any time in the app settings
Use part of the app without sharing data at all
Use or not use features of the app independently
Delete or update the information you provide to the app at any time
The data collected by the app is stored on your phone only.
No one else can access them unless you choose to share them.
The data you share gives health professionals more information about the virus and helps prevent the spread of the virus.
The data collected
The app collects and uses a combination of personal and anonymous data.
Personal details
You can choose to share your phone number, demographics and data related to your health.
You do not have to provide these details unless you wish.
Your phone automatically shares your ip address.
We do not need your ip address.
We delete this data as soon as your phone sends it to us.
Your phone number
We will only know your phone number if you choose to share it with us.
You may choose to share it if you need to receive a call if you are a close contact for someone who has tested positive for covid-19.
This placement can be changed at any time.
The app will only share your phone number with the hse if you are a close contact.
A contact tracking team will then call you to arrange a covid-19 test.
The app will share the latest date you were in close contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.
This is done so that we can give you the appropriate health advice based on how long ago you were unprotected by the virus.
The contact tracking team is given immediate contact phone numbers when talking to people who have tested positive for covid-19.
This means you can get a call from them even if you do not share your phone number in the app.
Health and demographic information
If you use the covid-19 app to check your signals, please share the following with us:
The county or town in which you live
Old group
D'inscne
Your symptoms of illness
If you share the information with us, it will be uploaded to the hse and shared anonymously with the central statistics office (cso).
This information helps us to understand more about the spread of the virus.
Whether or not you want to share this data with us is always your choice.
You can change the information you need to share with us at any time.
Read more about the data collected and processed.
Ip address
Your ip address is a unique collection of numbers that identifies your phone or computer when you use the internet.
Ip addresses are used so that you can send and receive information online.
Your ip address is automatically shared each time you use an app or visit a website.
We do not need your ip address.
We delete it from the server as soon as we receive the data you share with us from the app.
Unknown data
Anonymous data we collect includes:
Details of how you use the app
Data we use for contact tracking
Details on how you use the app
We collect data about how you use the app.
This is called 'app metric data'.
We collect this data in order to improve the app and to understand:
How the app is used
Its effect on slowing the spread of the virus
Metric data of this app does not reveal your name.
But it is your choice whether or not you want to share this data.
Contact tracking details
To enable contact tracking, the covid tracker uses a technology developed by apple and google called disclosure notification.
The disclosure notification enables your phone to create and share random ids.
These random ids are shared when you are in close contact with other users of the app.
You can read more about the disclosure notification system on the apple or google website.
The app uses this anonymous data to notify you of:
The time you spent with another unknown user of the app
The strength of the bluetooth signal of the other user of the other app and how to work out how close you were to them
That data stays on your phone.
No one can access them unless you choose to share them.
You will be asked if you wish to share the data with the hse if you test positive for covid-19.
Random ids shared with the hse are deleted every 14 days.
You can delete the app as well as the data collected on it whenever you want.
We have worked with apple and google to ensure that contact tracking functionality works effectively for as many phones as possible.
Third party bodies
For the functionality of the app, we use services from a number of companies.
These third-party companies process some data from the app, including your anonymous information.
Safe, secure and compliant
We created the app based on eu guidelines, eu recommendations on privacy, hse standards and data protection law.
This means that the app:
Safe and secure to use
Law-abiding
Meets the standards expected to keep data secure and confidential
Contact tracking on the entire app is decentralized.
The random ids on your phone are matched.
This means that no one can track your location, your movements or the people you have contacted.
Read more about compliance and security.
Deleting your data
You can choose to delete the app and delete your data at any time.
To do this:
Go to 'settings' in the app.
Select 'leave'.
Click on 'i want to leave'.
This will delete the app and your data.
When the government announces the outbreak is over, the app will no longer work.
You will be prompted to delete the app and all data.
It will no longer be available on the app stores either.

What you should do
Why you should track your signs
When you keep a record of your symptoms every day:
You will be able to remember when you became ill
It will be useful if you have to talk to your gp
It will help you get reliable advice quickly
It will help us map the virus and predict how it will spread.
The app will keep a record of your daily check-in for 28 days so you can review them.
Any health information you share will be anonymous.
You do not need to track your signals for other app functions to work.
How covid check-in works
Press the 'check-in covid' button at the bottom of the app.
You will be given 2 options:
'i'm fine, i have no sign '.
'i don't feel well today '.
If you have no symptoms
When you select 'i'm fine, i have no sign', your check-in will end
If you have symptoms
If you choose 'i don't feel well today', you will be asked 4 questions about normal covid-19 signals.
You will be given the latest advice based on your symptoms.
But if you have covid-19 symptoms, stay away from yourself and call your gp.

Tracking your signals
The technology used by the covid tracker app
Privacy and how we use your data
If you have been in close contact with another app user who tested positive for covid-19 you will receive an alert on your mobile phone.
What is the meaning of an immediate contact alert?
An immediate contact alert means that you have been within 2 meters of a person with the virus for a relatively long time (more than 15 minutes) and that you could get the virus.
You will never know who is infected or where the first contact occurred.
You will need to act as you could spread the virus to others.
What you should do
The alert will advise you to:
Restrict your movements if you have no symptoms.
Self-isolation if you have symptoms.
Get a covid-19 test.
It is important to follow this advice to protect yourself and others.
Arrange a test appointment
You will be asked if you want to share your phone number when you first launch the app on your mobile phone and when you receive an alert.
If you give us your phone number, the contact tracking team will be able to call you.
They will be able to arrange a free covid-19 test for you.
If you decide not to give us your phone number on the app, call the covid helpline.
They will take your data so that someone can call you and arrange a test for you.
You may receive a call from the contact tracking team even if you do not provide your phone number.
Sometimes this happens if someone else who tested positive for covid-19 gives your staff phone number because you are a close contact.
How to view the immediate contact alert
You will see an instant contact alert in 2 places on your mobile phone.
You will see it:
As a screen notification for a mobile phone
When you open the covid tracker app
Notice on the home screen
This is how you will see the alert notification on the home screen of your mobile phone.
The message in the notification will be: 'Close contact alert: Please see the covid tracker app now'.
Maybe it will go away after a while.
Alert within the covid administrator app
This is how you will see the alert notification when you open the covid tracker app.
This alert will be in a red box: 'Close contact alert: The app detects that you were in close contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19'.
This alert will remain on your phone for 14 days.
It will be on the screen for this period whenever you open the app.
The alert can be cleared in the app's contact tracking settings.
Potential disclosure alert
You will only see this alert if you are using an older version of the mobile phone operating system.
You should update your software and get the latest version of ios or android for free.
A potential exposure alert is not the same as an immediate contact alert.
You don ’ t have to do anything.
Potential exposure means that you may have been close to someone who tested positive for covid-19 but were not close enough for a long time to be a close contact.
Therefore there is little risk of you getting the virus.
For example, it could be someone who passed by on the street or queued them for less than 15 minutes.
If you work in a healthcare setting or school
There is little risk of you getting the virus if the people around you are wearing personal protective equipment, such as in a hospital or school.
However, you may receive an immediate contact alert anyway.
Healthcare workers
Read advice for healthcare workers who use the app and wear personal protective equipment.
Schools
If a covid-19 case has been confirmed in your school, you will be contacted by your local public health team.
They will tell you if you need to do anything.
If you receive an immediate contact alert and you receive a call from a contact tracker, tell them where you work.
If there has been a case recently, tell them.
They will be able to tell you what you should do.

You will be able to find information that will help you take care of yourself if you are ill.
Prioritize public health advice
The covid tracking app is designed to make the best use of the best available health advice and technology.
But it ’ s not perfect.
It is just one of our ways to delay the spread of covid-19, and current public health guidelines should not be ignored.
It is still important to:
Follow social separation advice - keep 2 meters (6.5 feet) away from others
Wash your hands often and adequately
Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or sleeve when you cough or sneeze
Wear a face cover
Get tested if you have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19
If you are unable to use the app
The app is just one aspect of our contact tracking operation.
The contact tracking centre is always open.
Everyone is included in that process, whether you use the app or not.
We hope that more people will have access to the updated versions of the app in the future.
We continue to look at solutions to include everyone over the age of 16.
Keep your child at home
If your child has had close contact with someone with covid-19, if your child lives with someone with covid-19 symptoms or has been abroad, do not allow them to go to school or attend childcare
They will have to restrict their movements for 14 days even if they have no signs of illness.
They may stop restricting their movements when both of the following conditions apply:
When they tested negative (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after contact with the person who tested positive.
When they do not have covid-19 symptoms.
If your child is in close contact with covid-19
If your child has covid-19 symptoms and is in close contact with someone who has tested positive, he / she should:
Stay away from others immediately
Call your gp
Follow the advice for children with covid-19 symptoms.
If your child is a close contact but does not have covid-19 symptoms:
Restrict your movements for 14 days - don't go to school either
Get a covid-19 test - this will be arranged by a contact administrator when he / she calls you
The child can stop restricting their movements if:
If they test negative (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after contact with the person who tested positive
If they do not have covid-19 symptoms
People living with the child, including siblings, do not need to restrict their movements.
If your child lives with someone suspected of having covid-19
Your child will need to restrict their movements.
If your child has symptoms, keep them away from others and call your doctor.
If your child was abroad
Your child will have to restrict their movements for 14 days if they have returned from a foreign country.
He will have to stay home and not attend school, even if he does not feel ill.
They only need to go to the gp if they have symptoms of illness.
A swab is taken from your nose during the covid-19 antigen test. The sample does not need to be taken to the laboratory.
The test results are faster than the covid-19 pcr test, but it is limited.
Antigen testing is also known as rapid antigen diagnostic testing (radt).
Where the covid-19 antigen tests are used
Antigen tests are provided for:
Some hospital patients with covid-19 symptoms, including those attending the emergency department (ed)
People in locations where there is an outbreak of covid-19
What happens during the test
The tester will give you a mask to explain what will happen and ask you some questions.
You will be asked to clean your hands properly with a hand disinfectant.
The tester will take some personal data from you, including your telephone number.
Make sure they have the correct number.
The tester will use a swab to take a sample from your nose.
This may be uncomfortable, but it will not be painful.
The tester will test the sample on-site.
If you get a positive result on your antigen test
Within 1 hour of your trial, you will be notified if a positive impact (covid-19 is found) on your test.
This means that the virus was detected in your sample.
You will have to stay on your own because there is a real risk that you will pass on the virus to others.
What you need to do if you have a positive covid-19 test result
If you get a negative or invalid result on your antigen test
A negative result indicates that the virus was not detected in your sample.
Sometimes a positive or negative result is not detected on the antigen test.
This is called an 'invalid result'.
If the first sample is negative or invalid, we will send the second sample to a laboratory for covid-19 pcr testing.
If the second test is positive
You will receive a text message with the result of the covid-19 pcr test.
If the result is positive, you will receive a phone call from a contact tracker.
Contact tracing
How to self-isolate (stay in your room)
There is a limit to what the antigen test for covid-19 can do
No complete test is accurate.
There is a limit to what any test can do,
Antigen testing is less accurate than pcr testing for covid-19.
The test will detect the virus in most people with symptoms of illness
But in some cases, the test will not detect the virus.
Tell the healthcare worker immediately if you have covid-19 symptoms.
The hse only accepts polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests to diagnose covid-19.
This is the most reliable way to test.
Private companies can offer other types of tests.
We do not recommend any particular test provider.
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you should isolate yourself immediately.
Call your doctor, and they will arrange a free hse test for you.
Read about how to test for covid-19.
Read about what to do if you are a close contact
Polymerase chain reaction test
This is the most reliable covid-19 test available because it looks at the genetic material of the virus.
The test is done in a laboratory and can be relied upon if you need to know if you have covid-19.
If you receive an isp test from a private company and test positive for covid-19, the laboratory must report this to the health service executive.
This information is required so that the contact tracking team can access your immediate contacts.
Read more about contact tracking.
Antigen testing
Antigen testing is faster than isp testing but not as reliable.
This type of test does not require a laboratory.
The hse does not currently accept antigen testing.
If your antigen test is positive
If you receive an antigen test from a private company and test positive for covid-19, the laboratory will not report this to the hse.
This means that your immediate contacts will not be notified and may spread covid-19 to others.
If you have tested positive, you should self-isolate and call your gp.
He / she will arrange for you a free isp test.
Find a doctor in your area.
You will need to show proof of the covid-19 test result to the doctor.
You will need one of the following:
Text message
Email
Printed report
If you have symptoms of illness but your test for covid-19 was negative
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you should self-isolate even if your antigen test result is negative.
Call your doctor, and they will arrange a free isp test for you.
Mas gartheagmhálaí animal
If you are a close contact, you should continue to restrict your movements even if your test was negative.
Continue to restrict your movements for 14 days from the last time you were in contact with the person who tested positive for the covid-19 test.
Antibody tests
Antibody tests check for antibodies if a person has had the virus in the past.
A blood sample is required to perform this test.
The hse does not currently offer these tests.
If you came to ireland from brazil or south africa:
You should isolate yourself (stay in your room) for 14 days from the date you arrived in ireland
Call your gp to arrange a covid-19 test - the test should be done five days after you arrive in ireland or as soon as you can after that five days.
If you do not have a gp, any doctor, or an out-of-hours doctor service, we can arrange a free covid-19 test for you.
This advice is being given because there are new strains of covid-19 in these countries.
These new strains of covid-19 are spreading faster than the other strains and are therefore more dangerous.
Positive test result
The following information is for people who have tested positive for covid-19:
People who recently arrived from south africa and brazil or
People living or working with a person who has come from south africa or brazil in the last 14 days
What you should do
Stay alone (stay in your room) for 14 days.
What your close contacts should do
All your contacts will need to be tested for covid-19.
They will have to wait on their own for 14 days.
Tell your close contacts to call their doctor and explain that they are in close contact with someone who has travelled from brazil or south africa.
The doctor will prioritize them for a covid-19 test.
When a face cover should be worn
If they develop symptoms, they will have to stay alone (stay in their rooms) and call their gps immediately.
Close contacts of close contacts
If you live with someone who has had close contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19 and recently came from south africa or brazil:
Please restrict your ghlauiseachtaí (stay at home) for 14 days
You do not need to take the covid-19 test
If they develop symptoms, they will have to stay alone (stay in their rooms) and call their gps immediately
Negative test result
If your test is negative (covid-19 not detected), there will be no need to test your immediate contacts.
You need to do a full 14 days of self-isolation, even if your test result is negative.
People living with you will have to restrict their movements (stay at home) for four days.
They should do this from the date they last contacted you.
If you have received a private test for covid-19
If you have already had a private test for covid-19, you will have to wait on your own for 14 days regardless of the result.
You should arrange another test for covid-19 through the out-of-hours doctor service or your gp.
If you develop symptoms of covid-19
Call your doctor to book a test for covid-19 and tell them that you have recently been to brazil or south africa and are showing signs of covid-19.
Do this even if your test was negative (covid-19 not detected).
If you do not have a doctor, you can call any doctor or the out-of-hours doctor service.
You can also seek advice through the ffs helpline.
If you do not have a pps number
When you call a gp to arrange a test, the doctor will ask you for your pps number.
If you do not have a pps number, you can give the number from any of the following:
European health insurance card (ehic)
Driving license
Not
National insurance
National health service
Medical card
Gp visit card
Vaccines undergo safety and efficacy tests before use.
The hse only uses a vaccine if it meets the appropriate safety and efficacy standards.
Development of the covid-19 vaccines
This vaccine was developed in a shorter time frame than usual.
They went through all stages of development at the same time and not in succession in order to be available as soon as possible.
How the vaccines were made so fast.
Work on the covid-19 vaccines was carried out more quickly than usual to make them available as soon as possible.
The usual steps required to provide a safe and effective vaccine were followed.
No shortcut was taken.
The covid-19 vaccines are approved

By law, you must wear a face mask:
On public transport
In shops, shopping malls and a number of other indoor locations
In banks, post offices and credit unions
Face cover should also be worn:
When it is not possible to stay away 2 meters from others
In hospitals, doctor's dispensary, nursing homes and at the dentist and other health centres
When people are visiting people who are at greater risk from covid-19 - e.g. people over the age of 70 or people who are vulnerable to health
In crowded workplaces, places of worship and busy outdoor places where many people gather
There are people who should not / cannot wear face cover.
Read about those who should not wear one.
When a disposable mask should be worn
A single-use mask is also called a surgical mask.
This is the usual type of face mask that is typically sold in pharmacies and other stores.
Wear a single-use mask instead of a face mask if you are at increased risk of contracting a serious illness caused by covid-19.
It is not the same as a face cover and gives you better protection.
You should wear a disposable mask at home
If you are self-isolated
If you tested positive for covid-19 - you must stay in your room
If you live with someone with covid-19
Read about face masks, masks and cellulite here
Why a face cover should be worn
Covid-19 is mainly spread by direct contact and droplets coming from your nose and mouth.
For example, when you are coughing, sneezing or talking loudly.
Wearing a facial cover reduces the spread of these droplets.
It also helps prevent people who do not know they have the virus from spreading it.
If you wear a face mask, you should do the other important things to prevent the spread of the virus.
These include:
Social separation
Covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve while coughing and sneezing
Wash your hands properly, and often
Not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless your hands are clean
Read the advice on how to protect yourself and others.
When a face cover should be worn.
By law, you must wear face cover on public transport, and:
Shops and pharmacies and i
Shopping centres
Libraries
Cinemas
Theaters
Concert halls
Bingo halls
Museums
Nail salon
Hair salon and barbers
Tattoo and piercing shops
Travel agents and tour operators
Laundry and dry cleaners
Bookmakers
When you can remove the face cover
You can remove the face cover to:
Talk to someone who has communication difficulties
Providing emergency assistance or care to a vulnerable person
Taking medication
You may be asked to remove your face cover to confirm your age or identity.
You can also remove your face cover when you are:
Eating and drinking in a restaurant or café - throw one when you're not at your table
When you are receiving medical or dental treatment
You do not need to wear a face cover if you have an illness or weakness that would make it difficult for you to wear a face cover.
People who should not wear a face cover
Face masks are not recommended for the following:
Someone who has trouble breathing
Unconscious person or speech
A person who is unable to remove it without help
A person with special needs or hearing difficulties or who is deaf
A person who communicates with a person with learning difficulties or who is hard of hearing or deaf
In cases like this, the person will get some protection from the cellar if they are able to wear it.
But it is only in these cases that cells should be consumed.
It is best to wear a face cover made of cloth to protect yourself from covid-19.
Letters of exemption
Some workplaces or schools may request a medical certificate.
But generally, you do not need to ask for a letter from a gp about your reason for not wearing a face cover.
Children and face covers
Children under the age of 13 are not advised to wear face masks, but some children may choose to wear one.
There is a good chance that young children will not follow the advice on how to wear face masks properly.
But children under 13 should wear face cover if their doctor or healthcare worker recommends they do so.
For example, some children may be encouraged to do this while attending a hospital clinic for example.
Children who may be under 13 in their first year of secondary school should wear face cover while attending school.
This is because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can follow the advice on using face masks properly.
There is no evidence that a coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.
However, it can be spread through close contact with someone who has the virus.
Reducing your risk of contracting the coronary virus
You may not know if someone has a coronavirus.
There is some risk of getting the virus if you are sexually active with another person.
You can reduce this risk by:
Have sexual intercourse with a partner you live with and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus
Don't kiss anyone outside your family and anyone with symptoms - it's easy to spread the crown virus by kissing
Wash your hands properly before and after sex
If you decide to have sex with someone who does not live with you, limit it to a few partners as possible, one regular partner if possible.
Read more about sex and the crown virus on sexual wellbeing. ie
Read more about how the coronavirus is spread.
Restriction on sexually transmitted infection (sti) services
Many sti services are currently restricted due to the coronavirus.
Telephone support is available in some services.
Further information is available on the hiv ireland website.
Contraception
Pharmacies are open as usual and can give you your usual contraceptive prescription.
If your hormonal contraceptive prescription is to be renewed, your pharmacist may be able to provide you with extra supplies if it is safe and appropriate to do so.
Emergency contraception
You can get emergency (hormonal) contraception without a prescription from your local pharmacy.
Call your pharmacist to see if they can do the consultation over the phone.
This reduces the amount of time you have to spend in the pharmacy.
Emergency hormonal contraception can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex.
The sooner you take it, the more effective it becomes.

Your child is tired (very tired) or irritable and can't calm down with toys, food, tv or if you pick it up - and especially if this happens after their temperature has dropped
Your child shaking badly or complaining of muscle aches
Your child constantly having constant nausea or pain in his stomach
The test for covid-19 may be done on your child
There are many possible causes for your child to become ill suddenly.
Covid-19 does not usually cause serious illness in children, but it sometimes does.
That's why your doctor would have to rule out covid-19.
Your gp will ask your child to test for covid-19 if they have been in contact with someone who has had a negative result.
Your child may also need to be tested for covid-19 in the following situations:
Unless your gp is unsure of your child 's illness
Someone else in the house is sick but does not know why
What will happen next?
Your gp will assess your child and recommend treatment for their symptoms of illness.
You will be asked to keep an eye on your child in case it gets worse.
Your child will need to stay away from others until they know for sure that they do not have covid-19 by:
Different diagnosis or
Negative test result
Staying away from others is like keeping your child at home and separated from others.
Do not allow any visitors.
Read advice on how to care for a child who has to self-isolate.
Make sure your child continues to wash their hands properly and regularly and follow the cough and sneezing advice; wash their hands properly and regularly and follow hygiene advice around coughing and sneezing.
If your child is not tested and your doctor does not know what their illness is, they will be treated as if they had covid-19.
Everyone who has been in contact with your child should be aware of the symptoms of covid-19 in case the symptoms occur.
Pediatric multiple inflammatory syndrome (pims)
A small number of children with coronavirus had to undergo hospital treatment for an inflammatory syndrome known as pediatric multiple systemic inflammatory syndrome (pims).
Pims is a life-threatening disorder.
It is caused by an abnormal response of the body's immune system to infection.
It is similar to kawasaki disease or toxic disturbance syndrome and is uncommon.
We do not know if these children received pims because they had covid-19.
It is too early to see if there is any connection.
Children who require hospital treatment for pims are now being tested for the virus.
This is a precaution.
It is important that your children are involved in your plans to deal with the coronavirus.
Think about how they feel.
Give children and young people time and space to talk about the outbreak.
Share the facts with them in a way that suits their age and attitude, and do not be afraid.
Talk to your children about covid-19 (coronavirus).
Restrict what news and social media they see.
This is especially important for older children as they spend more time online.
It could be a cause for concern for them.
If they are online, tell them where to find accurate information.
Children with autism and intellectual disabilities
Use stories to help children with autism understand coronavirus - from the autism charity 'as i am'.
Gps, hospitals and other health services are open and providing care to patients.

Signs of illness - call your gp
It is important to remember that 9 out of 10 people who have blood in their bowel movements (shit) will not have cancer.
A small growth called polyps or other illnesses such as ficus (hemorrhoids) can cause blood in your shit.
It is very important to be aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer.
Signs include:
The constant change in normal bowel movements.
Going more often, with diarrhoea with pain in the stomach sometimes
Blood in your shit, especially if it is mixed through the shit.
This makes it unlikely that hemorrhoids are the cause
Stomach pain, discomfort, or abdomen that is constant after eating.
Sometimes you don't eat as much, or you lose weight
Symptoms of bowel cancer are also prevalent, and most people who have these symptoms do not have cancer. For example:
A change in normal bowel movements is usually caused by something eaten by a person
You probably don't have a lousy illness if you don't go to the toilet as often, or if the shit gets harder.
It may be worth trying laxatives before going to the doctor.
Rarely hard and shit
Fresh blood not in the shit itself or covering the shit.
This is often seen in pain due to hemorrhoids or minor cuts
You should be more careful about these symptoms as you age and if they persist despite simple treatments.
If you notice any of them, please contact your gp.
Signs of bowel cancer
Screening will resume according to public health advice as coronary virus restrictions are mitigated.
We will continue to keep a close eye on this guide to ensure that you and our staff are safe.
If you would like to contact us, please call freephone.

Waiting outside until it's time to go to your appointment
Fewer people in the healthcare building or mobile unit
Waiting a little longer for your appointment because the unit must be completely disinfected between each screening

Starting again safely
Breastcheck permanent units continue to help their host hospitals assess and treat women with cancer symptoms and prioritize patients with advanced or aggressive cancer.
During this work, all breastcheck mobile units are being adapted so that they can provide a safe environment for patients and staff when breast screening resumes.
The resumption of screening will depend on the state of covid-19 and the easing of government restrictions.
We will continue to check that the screening system is functioning well during the restart period in the interests of your safety and the safety of our staff.

Advice for people at greater risk from covid-19
Find out what their needs are other than medical needs.
If they are worried about anything, think of ways to support them.
For example, having regular video chats with people if it is not possible to meet them in person.
You may have already received a call from your standard service if the person you are caring for is at high risk.
If not, you should call your service provider to discuss an emergency plan.
If you do not have a service provider, call your public health nurse or the disability manager at local hse disability services.

Protecting your child from covid-19
Covid-19 (coronavirus) can affect children as well as adults.
But few cases have been reported in children worldwide.
Children also appear to get a milder infection than adults or the elderly.
They often have no symptoms.
Children do not spread the virus more than adults, and they rarely cause the virus to spread in families.
Read here what to do if your child has covid-19 symptoms.
If you are worried about your child's health, call your gp.
Protecting your child
The most important things you can do to protect your child are:
Follow the advice on how to protect yourself and others from covid-19
Watch out for covid-19 symptoms - if your child has covid-19 symptoms, they will need to isolate themselves and call their gp
Encourage your child to wash their hands regularly and properly
Clean and disinfect all surfaces in your home and all areas where people touch them.
Do not forget the hands of the doors, the remote control and the toilet.
Follow the advice to prevent your child from getting or spreading viral infections
Face and child covers
Face covers are not recommended for children under 13.
Young children may not be able to follow the advice of wearing a mask properly.
They should wear a face mask if advised to do so by a doctor or healthcare worker, for example, when attending a hospital clinic.
Children over 13 should follow the advice given to adults about wearing face masks.
They must wear face covers when entering a shop or when travelling on public transport and should wear a face cover whenever it is difficult to stay 2 meters away from others.
All secondary school children should wear face cover in secondary school, even if they are under 13.
It is because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can follow the advice on face cover properly.
See how your children should wash their hands
If your child has symptoms of coronavirus
This advice is usually for infants and children under 12 or 13 years of age attending primary school.
Secondary school children with symptoms should follow the adults' advice on when to contact their gp for a covid-19 (coronavirus) test.
Keep your child at home
Do not allow your child to go to school or attend a childcare centre if they have covid-19 symptoms.
He may have to stay away from others.
This will depend on the symptoms.
Read more about when a child should be kept home from school or a childcare centre.
When to seek emergency medical help
Read more about the symptoms in children and infants who need emergency medical help.
If your child suddenly becomes very ill, it is unlikely to be a coronary virus.,
The symptoms may be caused by another illness.
If your baby is under three months old and has a high temperature (38 degrees celsius or more), call 999 or 112.
If your baby is between 3 and 6 months old and has a high temperature, contact your gp immediately.
If your child has common symptoms of covid-19
Common symptoms of covid-19 are:
Temperature 38 degrees celsius or more
New cough - they can be coughs of any kind, not just dry
Loss or change in taste or smell
Shortness of breath
If your child has common symptoms of covid-19:
Keep your child away from others - this means you have to keep them in a room by themselves without any contact with others as much as possible.
Call a gp - they will tell you if your child needs a covid-19 test.
Everyone living with your child should restrict their movements.
This means they cannot go to school, childcare or work until it is safe.
Test your child's symptoms at home.
The child should only leave the house to be tested or to see a doctor.
Call your gp first.
Do not take your child to the doctor unless the doctor says so.
If your child has other symptoms that a person with covid-19 does not normally have
Less common covid-19 symptoms include:
Sore throat
Headache
Feeling sick or vomiting
If your child has any of these symptoms, keep them at home for at least 48 hours.

The people living with your child do not need to restrict their movements unless they are sick.
After 48 hours, your child can return to school or a childcare centre as long as:
His symptoms do not get worse
It does not come with new signs
Does not require paracetamol or ibuprofen for 48 hours - this may mask a fever if it is
No one else living with it has been ill or has tested positive for covid-19
Thorny or sneezing nose
If your child only has a runny nose or sneezes, it's okay to let them go to school.
Read more advice on sneezing or sneezing and why it's okay to let your child go to school or a childcare centre

But it is a sign of infection.
It may pass this infection to other children.
If your child has a long-term breathing illness getting worse
If your child has a long-term breathing illness that has brought worse:
Keep your child away from others
Everyone living with your child should restrict their movements
If your child has undiagnosed symptoms but does not need a covid-19 test
Sometimes your gp may not know why your child is ill.
He may not be able to diagnose his symptoms.
He may decide based on his symptoms that your child does not need to take the covid-19 test.
If this happens, your child should behave as if they have covid-19.
This is done to keep others safe.
It is not possible to be sure that your child does not have the virus.
He will have to continue to stay away from others.
He will have to remain alone until he meets both of these conditions:
Without high temperature (38 degrees celsius or more) for five days
It has been ten days since symptoms first appeared

Visiting nursing homes and residential care centres
People living in nursing homes and residential care facilities can have two of your le 4 have a weekly visit, provided the facility has a high level of vaccination.
This is done in compassionate circumstances under level 5 restrictions.
Covid-19 can spread quickly and can do a lot of harm if received in a nursing home or residential care centre (scf).
You can spread the virus, even if you only have mild symptoms, or if you have no symptoms or even if you feel well.
If you have recently arrived in ireland from britain or south africa, stay alone for 14 days and not visit a nursing home or residential care centre.
Visits
The arrangements for visiting residents in nursing homes and residential care centres are as follows:
One visit per week from one person under level 3 and level 4 restrictions
One fortnightly visit from one person under level 5 - for critical and compassionate reasons only
Level 5 restrictions apply in the state.
The visit should only last an hour.
It is not necessary to visit the same person every time.
It is the resident 's choice whether or not to admit a visitor.
Talk to staff if a more extended visit is required, for example, at the end of life.
In cases like this, more than one visitor may arrive.
If you have to visit in critical and compassionate circumstances, you should follow the advice below in the interests of keeping everyone safe.
Critical and compassionate visits
Additional visits for critical and compassionate circumstances may be permitted in cases such as:
End of life
If a resident is very worried or upset and a visit from someone close to them may put them at ease
If there is an important event in the life of the resident
If you do not have the opportunity to visit again for a few months or years, for example, if you are leaving the country or nearing the end of your life.
If you have to make financial or other arrangements or to advocate on behalf of the resident
Outdoor visits
Outdoor visits are permitted, as long as people stay two meters apart (social separation) at all times and if the resident is able to get outdoors.
Such visits must be arranged in advance.
Visits at the window
It is always possible to talk to residents outside of their open windows or on the phone but stay a safe distance from each other.
Such visits must be arranged in advance.
Before you visit
The nursing home will usually seek the contact details of named visitors in advance.
Check in advance if it is ok to visit.
The staff will probably give you a specific time.
You will have to come and go at the agreed times.
You will be asked a number of questions before you visit to make sure you have no covid 19 sign.
Your temperature may be raised before you enter the centre.
The management of the centre has the right to decide whether or not you can visit.
If you are unable to visit your relative, it may worry you.
The restrictions are in place to keep you, your family member and the healthcare staff safe.
Sometimes a resident may have to leave with the visitor to deal with something very important such as some personal need, the death of a family member or a visit to a family grave.
A plan will be prepared to keep the resident as safe as possible for themselves and other residents.
Read about how to take care of your mental health during a coronary virus outbreak.
During your visit
You will need to wear a face cover or medical mask during your visit.
The cover should be left on you even if you are alone and 2 meters apart.
In some cases, it is best to remove the mask:
If it is too difficult to communicate with your family and wear the mask
If your relative is unable to identify you with the mask on you
If the mask offends your loved one
If you have trouble wearing a face mask, you can wear face masks.
Cells are not as good as face cover and may not give you or your family the same protection, but they will give you some protection.
You may also be asked to wear a protective apron.
You must adhere to the advice on protecting yourself and others against covid-19
Wash your hands properly when entering and leaving patients
You can bring a gift or anything else they want.
Each visit usually lasts 1 hour.
If you need a more extended visit for compassionate circumstances, talk to staff about it.
If an outbreak of the crown virus breaks out
If a covid-19 outbreak breaks out at the centre or facility, visits will be suspended for some time.
One person will be able to make one fortnightly visit to residents under level 5 restrictions.
Exceptions will be made in special cases, for example, if a person is in danger of death or if the outbreak is in a particular place.
You can discuss this with the team.
Times you should not visit
Do not visit if:
You have been told that you are a close contact with someone with the coronavirus
You have any signs of coronavirus or any other infection such as a cold or flu
You have signs of gastroenteritis, such as diarrhea and vomiting
If you have any of these illnesses, you should wait at least 2 days after the signal has gone before you visit.

Why diet and nutrition help your health
It is important for all of us to eat healthy food.
It helps us stay as healthy as we can.
But eating healthy food is sometimes not easy.
Only a third of the irish population eat the recommended amount of vegetables, salads and fruit every day.
Many people eat unhealthy food, such as chocolate, cakes and biscuits, every day.
In ireland, 62% of the adult population is overweight or obese.
One in four children is seven years old, overweight or obese.
Benefits of healthy eating
Healthy eating will help you avoid certain diseases.
If you have kids, they will follow your good example of eating healthy food.
Eating healthy food can lead to the following.
Healthy weight
Healthy weightless risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer
Healthy cholesterol level
A better understanding of well-being
Diet, nutrition and your body
Food contains nutrients such as protein, fat and vitamins.
Your body needs the right mix of nutrients to be healthy and wholesome.
Different foods contain different nutrients.
If you choose a combination of foods every day, you will be able to get all the nutrients you need to grow and be healthy.
That ’ s what a balanced diet means.
The same types of nutrients are grouped as follows:
Vegetables, salads and fruit
Wholegrain cereals and bread, potatoes, pasta and rice
Low-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese
Fat-free meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts
Fats, spreads and oils
The body gets energy (calories) from the food you eat.
If you take in more calories than you use, you will gain weight and become overweight.
If you do not take in enough calories, you will be below normal weight.
Either of these is bad for your health.
Eat healthy food
Making small changes to your diet can make a big difference to your health now and in the future.
Treat the symptoms of coronavirus at home
There is no specific treatment for covid-19, but some covid-19 symptoms can be treated at home.
80% of people will recover at home - they will not have to go to the hospital.

Healthy food for families
Children grow fast, so they need food to get the right amount of energy, protein and other nutrients.
Eating healthy food will help children grow, learn and play.
It will also help prevent various illnesses, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer when they grow up.
You can use the food pyramid to plan meals and snacks for children over 5 years old.
How to eat well
Types of healthy food
Sometimes it is difficult for busy families to eat good food every day.
But good habits that children learn at home will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
What children are advised to eat according to the food pyramid:
Healthy food for children
Every parent wants the best for their child as they grow up.
What young children eat and drink is important for their health now and in the future.
Healthy school lunch
It is sometimes difficult to provide a healthy, interesting lunch that school children would enjoy. Children get one-third of their daily nutritional needs from their lunch, so it ’ s important to do some thinking and planning about it.
How to make healthier choices
Making healthy choices is often not easy.
It doesn ’ t have to be perfect.
It involves making changes.
Stick with them, and you will succeed.
Good habits that our children learn at home will stay with them for a lifetime.
Small changes in diet and activity for children can make a big difference to their future health.
If your kids see that you are active and eating healthy food at all times, they are more likely to do the same.
The right weight for your child
Many children in ireland (about one in five) are overweight.
Many parents are unaware that their children are carrying too much weight.
For the most part, eating more food than they need to grow and activity will add up weight.
If children are overweight, it can create health problems for them in the future.
Ask your gp or nurse to measure your child's weight and height during your next visit.
They will be able to tell you if your child is overweight or obese.
They will use a growth chart to find out if your child is currently overweight or overweight.
If your child is overweight if they reduce the amount of food they eat and become more active, they will achieve the right weight.
Check your child's body mass index (bmi) on the nhs healthy weight calculator.
You can also use this calculator to check your own bmi to see if you have a healthy weight.
It becomes difficult to talk to your child about weight.
When talking about weight with your child, it is important to emphasize health.

The death of a person and the grief that follows during the outbreak of the coronavirus
We need to adhere to the social separation and other measures caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus (covid-19). Things have to be done differently now that someone related to us dies.
A confidential support line is available from the irish hospice foundation and the hse.
If you need more support, use one of the telephone or online mental health support services available to you.
If your grief is getting worse, or you are having trouble sleeping, talk to your gp.
Talk to your gp, if you are seriously worried or have difficulty sleeping.
Funeral / funeral
We cannot spend time together in groups during the outbreak.
This means that we cannot have a grand funeral / funeral.
Those at the funeral must also follow the guidelines for social separation.
This means that people have to wait for two meters (6.5 feet) apart.
You should not go to a funeral if you are self-isolated or need to restrict your movements.
Death affects every family.
We know that these arrangements make matters even more difficult, but we are trying to protect everyone.
The funeral director and your priest, minister etc, will know what to do.
Advice for those who are sad at this time
The death of someone close to us hurts us all.
It can affect your mental health.
There is no right or wrong way to deal with death.
You may feel many different emotions.
Release your feelings and handle them in a way that suits you best.
This is part of the way we deal with death.
Stay in touch with others.
We cannot be together in groups at this time.
Because of this, you may not be able to meet people who want to sympathize with you.
While you may be physically separated from your normal support network, do not cut yourself off from them.
Let people express their sympathy and let them support you in different ways.
Phone calls, texts, emails, and support messages on social media from the people closest to you can comfort you.
Contact them and make sure to contact someone every day.
Answer their calls and answer their messages.
Stay in touch with the people who offend you, but if the messages of support are excessive for you, there is no need to reply to them.
While it is important to stay in touch, do not do so until you are ready.
Eat healthy food
Try not to neglect what is necessary.
Even if your stomach is not good, try to eat healthy food and drink plenty of water.
This will help you stay physically fit while you are sad.
Do the daily routines
It may help you to maintain normal habits.
Try to do the things you normally do every day, as much as you can.
It is important that you do these things at the same times, eat a meal, get up and go to bed and so on.
Go out in the garden or on your balcony to get some fresh air, if you can.
Live day today
You may feel okay on certain days, and the sadness may not be as bad as on other days - that's normal.
Some people may feel guilty when this happens, but there is no need for that.
Try to be nice to yourself and understand your feelings every day.
This happens naturally when a person is grieving a death.
Caring for bereaved children
If children in your family are sad, keep an eye on them.
Answer their questions honestly.
Children are better able to handle a sad story when they are told the truth.
Children may be sad one minute and happy the next.
Let them follow their own course.
There is no right or wrong way to show their sadness.
Try to give honest, age-appropriate information about death.
Let the kids guide you.
Let their questions guide the conversation.
Don ’ t worry if you can ’ t answer every question they ask.
Tell them you will get the information for them and try to start the conversation again when you have the answers.
If you think it's timely, start talking about the person who died and their memories of that person.
Limit news and social media
Try to limit the amount of news and social media you watch.
When you are sad, the news may upset you and make you or your family even sadder.
Ways to help others who are grieving
To help a friend or family member of you who is grieving, think about how you can extend your condolences to them at this time.
There are other ways you can comfort them if you are not in their company.
Text or call - ask your friend how they are, ask them what could help them and listen carefully
Leave food or a gift at the door as a sign of consolation
Offer practical help, for example, shopping
Offer assistance with technology such as video calls, whatsapp or other ways to keep in touch
Express your condolences online on rip.ie or similar
Write a card
Whichever way you choose to express your sympathy, be sure to contact them.
Let them know that you are available not only in the short term but in the coming weeks and months.
Remember that the person may not always want to talk to you.
That's okay too - it's important to give them space.
It is also important for them to know that you are there when they need you most.

People who are seriously ill in hospital will get their results first.
Do not call your gp to get the test results.
It is important to keep the phone lines free for people seeking advice on symptoms of illness.
If you did the test because you had symptoms
If you have not received your test results, you can stop self-isolation if you meet both of these conditions:
Have you not had a fever (38 degrees celsius or above) in the last 5 days
That 10 days have passed since the symptoms first came to you
If you took the test because you were a close contact
If you are a close contact and have no symptoms continue to restrict your movements (stay at home) for 14 days.
Do this from the last date you were in contact with the person who tested positive for covid-19.
If you are unsure of the date, restrict your movements to the date the contact tracking team told you to do so.
You can stop restricting your movements when both of these conditions apply:
You tested negative for your test (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after you last contacted the person who tested positive.
You do not have covid-19 symptoms
Living with a close contact
If you live with a close contact, you do not have to restrict your movements while waiting for their test or test results.
Pregnancy and covid-19
We are still learning about covid-19 (coronavirus).
We don ’ t really understand how it hurts pregnant women and their babies.
Our knowledge to date indicates that pregnant women are not at risk if they receive covid-19.
Our knowledge to date shows that the risk of getting the virus during pregnancy is no greater than for women of the same age who are not pregnant.
Contact your local hospital if you are worried that your baby is not moving as much as usual or if you are worried about their well-being.
The hospital will perform tests to confirm that your baby is ok.
Protecting yourself and your baby
To protect yourself and your baby, you should carefully follow the advice below:
Wash hands properly
Social separation
Stay at home
Call your gp for advice if you have any of the symptoms of the coronavirus.
If you get covid-19
If you test positive for covid-19, contact your maternity unit or hospital.
The hospital will be able to monitor your pregnancy if you get the virus properly.
Pregnant women usually have mild symptoms when they receive covid-19.
They have a normal birth and are at low risk of giving their infants covid-19.
Contact your local hospital if you are worried that your baby is not moving as much as usual or if you are worried about their well-being.
The hospital will perform tests to confirm that your baby is ok.
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you will most likely need to go into hospital and the intensive care unit.
You may be at greater risk of becoming prematurely or having a stillbirth, if you have symptoms than if you have no symptoms.
Covid plaintitis and stillbirth
There is a link between a tiny number of stillbirths and an illness known as covid plasticitis.
Covid plasticitis occurs when the plaque is infected with covid-19.
This interferes with the placenta's ability to give the baby oxygen and nutrients.
Stillbirth is mostly linked to covid plaquepox when covid-19 infection rates are very high.
As the covid-19 infection rate falls, this will not be a concern.
Contact your maternity unit or hospital immediately if you notice that your baby is not moving normally.
A high fever during pregnancy
Symptoms of coronavirus include fever (high temperature).
This may create difficulties for you during the first trimester (weeks 0 to 13).
If you experience a high temperature during your pregnancy, call your gp or midwife.
When you become pregnant, your body's immune system gradually changes.
This happens in order for your pregnancy to have a successful outcome.
You could get more infections more quickly because you are pregnant.
All pregnant women should get the following vaccines:
Whooping cough vaccine
Flu vaccine
Covid-19 vaccine - when you get the offer
Before your child is born
The staff caring for you should make sure that you are involved in all decisions that are made.
If you are worried about your pregnancy, call your hospital for advice.
Maternity hospitals have helplines open to advise you at any time.
That said, you should go to the hospital if you have any concerns about the movement of your unborn baby.
More information on: Mychild.ie
Appointments and scanning
Antenatal care continues to be provided in hospitals.
If you are receiving care in the hospital and from your gp, continue with this.
A number of appointments are made over the phone, followed by a short hospital visit.
You will need to go to the hospital for examinations, a blood test and an ultrasound scan.
You should go it alone to reduce the number of people in the hospital.
Fetal anatomy scan - scanned at 20 weeks
The fetal anatomical scan is usually performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.
It is also called an anomaly scan.
A birth partner is usually able to attend the fetal anatomy scan with you.
This will depend on the hospital and current government restrictions.
A prior check with the hospital is required.
If your birth partner is unable to attend, you will be explained why.
If you have a coronary virus before your baby is born
If you have a coronary virus, your healthcare team will be much more careful.
This will continue before, during and after the birth of your baby.
Your obstetrician or midwife will talk to you about the safest way and time to give birth.
Other doctors with expertise may be involved in your care.
This could be a doctor dealing with infectious diseases and a neonatal doctor - that is, a doctor who deals with newborn babies.
You may be cared for in an isolation room with an en-suite during your labour.
You may have to stay in this room while you are in hospital.
During the birth of your baby and the childbirth
In most cases, your partner will be able to be present during the birth of your child.
Every effort will be made to ensure that your partner is present at the birth, but in some hospitals, your partner may not be able to attend.
There are restrictions to keep everyone safe.
If your partner can be with you, they will need to wear personal protective clothing to reduce the risk of infection.
You will not need to wear a face mask during childbirth and birth.
But, you will need to wear a mask when you are outside your room.
After the birth of your child
Visitors to the hospital
No visitor is allowed in any maternity unit.
These restrictions are in the interests of your safety and the safety of your child.
These restrictions will be lifted as soon as possible.
Going home early
Many women choose to go home early because of the restrictions on hospital visitors.
Phone support from postpartum midwives is available from some hospitals.
Community midwives will be making home visits wherever this is available.
Neonatal care in the neonatal intensive care unit
In most neonatal intensive care units (nicus), only a 15-minute visit is now allowed.
This is being done to protect vulnerable infants.
These restrictions will be lifted when it is safe to do so.
Some units have the technology to enable parents to have contact with their infants.
If you have a coronary virus after the birth of your baby
If you have covid-19, your doctor or midwife will discuss your options after giving birth.
One option is for someone else to take care of your baby until the covid-19 is gone.
This is recommended to protect your baby from covid-19.
This care could be provided by a family member or healthcare worker.
This could be provided at home or in hospital.
It is not known how long this will last.
The advice will depend on your symptoms of illness and the results of the test you will have.
Taking care of your baby if you have covid-19
If you choose to take care of your baby, the doctor or midwife will explain the danger to you.
You and your baby will be placed in an isolation room with an en-suite bathroom.
Your baby will be inside an incubator in your room.
This is a unique cradle made of plastic.
It keeps the lovely infant warm.
You will be able to see your baby inside the incubator.
When you take your baby out of the incubator to be fed, washed, or otherwise cared for, you must:
Dress with long sleeves and wear a surgical mask
Wash your hands properly and often with soap and water or rubbing alcohol - before and after handling your baby
Your child should be monitored for signs of infection.
This will continue for 14 days from the last time you had contact with your baby.
If your child shows any signs of infection, they will need to be tested.

If steroids and other medications for hay fever do not work for you, your gp may refer you for immunotherapy.
You will be given small doses of pollen by injection or in tablets.
You will gradually gain immunity from the pollen..
This treatment is usually done in the winter about 3 months before the start of the hay fever season.
Protect yourself and others from the coronavirus
There is no vaccine for the coronavirus.
Think about the way the crown virus spreads to protect you and others (covid-19).
Coronavirus is spread by sneezing or coughing.
It must pass from the nose or mouth of an infected person into your eyes, nose or mouth to get the virus.
This can happen directly or indirectly (on hands, objects, surfaces).
Remember this.
It will help you remember all the things you need to do to protect yourself and others from the virus.
Level 3 restrictions apply in every county in the state.
There is more information on gov.ie regarding the restriction levels throughout the state.
Take responsibility, stay a safe
As public health restrictions are eased, hand washing and respiratory hygiene and social separation are of paramount importance.
There is a risk of another outbreak of the virus.
Everyone should be sensible and follow the advice below to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Try not to meet so many people outside your home and don't spend too much time with them.
You should:
Wearing a face mask on public transport - this is the law, and you can be fined or refused entry if you don't wear a mask
Work away from home if possible - if you can't work from home, stay 2 months away from others
Avoid crowded places as much as possible - leave if social separation is not possible.
Not use public transport unless necessary - walk or cycle if you can
Stay clear of places where you cannot stay 2 months away from others if possible
Wear face cover when visiting people over 70 or other vulnerable people- practice social separation for safety.
Can:
Meet people indoors and outdoors on social occasions but stay 2 meters away from others
To attend medical appointments and collect medicines and medical products

Visit outdoor areas, playgrounds and sites, if you can stay at least 2 meters away from others
Do not ignore any delays in seeking treatment if you have unusual signs or symptoms
Social separation
Social separation is important to delay the spread of the coronavirus.
Contact between infected and healthy people will be reduced.
Stay away 2 meters (6 feet) from others
Avoid shared sleeping areas
Avoid crowded places
Do not shake hands or have close contact with others, if possible
There is little danger if you are just passing someone.
But try to stay 2 meters away as much as possible.
Social separation at work
Follow the advice on social segregation everywhere outside your home, including your workplace.
If you are returning to work, read about the safe return to work.

You are concerned about the implementation of social segregation measures in the workplace
If you are the employer and need advice on preventing crown virus in the workplace
Isolate yourself if you have symptoms of coronavirus
Be very careful if you are in a group at risk from coronavirus
Cocooning of people at high risk (extremely vulnerable)
What to do if you live with someone who has the symptoms of coronavirus
Travel and coronavirus
Good hygiene and hand washing
Good hygiene and proper handwashing will help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Follow this advice as much as possible and encourage others to do the same.
Wash your hands often and adequately.
Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve when coughing and sneezing.
Put the handkerchief in a bin and wash your hands.

The covid tracker is a free and easy to use app and:
Will alert you to close contact if someone you have had close contact with gets a positive result for covid -19
It will give you advice on how to protect yourself and others
It will alert other users of the app with whom you have had close contact if you get a positive result for the coronavirus
The app is part of our contact tracking.
Contact tracking is very important to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
The more people who find and uses the app, the better the contact tracking.
It will help us stay safe when we meet people socially, at work or while traveling, if we use the app and follow the public health advice on this page.
Visitors
Don't meet too many people outside your home and spend too much time with them.
No house should have more than ten visitors (from a maximum of 4 nets).
The house should be large enough to have a distance of 2 meters between each person and plenty of air inside.
Keep yourself and your visitors safe.
Do not visit others if:
You would have any sign of the crown virus
If the contact trackers told you that you had close contact with someone who had the virus
Check with people in advance before you visit that they have no signs and are feeling well.
If visitors are able to stay 2 meters apart, it is not necessary to wear a face cover.
If people cannot remain 2 meters apart, everyone should wear a face cover.
Wear a face mask every time you visit people over 70 or others who are healthily vulnerable.
Clean your hands regularly and tell visitors to wash their hands when they enter.
Do not wear disposable gloves instead of cleaning your hands.
The virus affects them the same way it gets on your hands.
Corruption can get on the hands when you remove them.
When your visitors disappear, clean all surfaces they have been in contact with.
Use for routine household cleaning and disinfectants.
Compassionate visits

Organizations that provide advice to employers and employees
Shopping safely during the coronary virus outbreak
The biggest danger of shopping is being in contact with an infected person.
When shopping, you should:
Wear a face cover
Practice best hygiene practices
Practice social separation
Without contact with people outside of those who live with you
Someone who passes by in the store is not much of a danger to you.
But stay away from 2 meters away as much as possible.
Face cover
By law, you must wear a face cover while shopping because it can be difficult to practice social separation while in a store.
Face covers should also be worn in busy or crowded outdoor spaces, such as a shopping street.
However, face coverage is not suitable for everyone.
It ’ s okay if certain people choose not to wear them.
Facial cover is not suitable for children under 13 or for people with special needs as they may be upset or very uncomfortable to wear.
When you should stay home
Don ’ t go out shopping if you ’ re feeling sick
If you are at greater risk from covid-19, consider doing your shopping online or ask someone to shop for you.
If you need help, you can also contact your local county council.
They have community support in place to deliver essential goods.
Read more about how local authorities can help you during the coronary virus outbreak.
Reduce the risk while shopping
Only go shopping when necessary.
This reduces the risk of contracting or spreading covid-19.
When you are shopping
Use the disinfectant provided, on your hands, the trolley or basket.
Remember to make no contact with your face.
Wear a face mask if you're over 13 - but don't wear it if you feel uncomfortable wearing it
If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve.
Follow the guidelines for social separation - stay 2 meters away from others in queues when shopping.
Pay by card rather than cash - a contactless payment method may reduce the risk of infection.
If you use cash, the risk is low, especially if you clean your hands regularly after handling cash.
After shopping
Wash your hands properly
Save your shopping
Wash your hands again
Show respect for others
Only buy what you need - it is restocked in stores daily.
Do not go shopping during the hours set for healthcare workers and carers.
Delivery and collection services are very important for people who are cocooning and are unable to leave their homes.
Only reserve delivery times if necessary.
Shopping for a vulnerable person
How covid-19 is spread
Direct contact
Local restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus
You could get the virus from someone who has the virus if you have close contact with it.
It is spread in droplets from your nose and mouth, e.g. when someone is talking loudly, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing.
This happens when people are 1 to 2 meters apart.
This is why the spread of the virus is reduced when you keep a distance of 2 meters from others.
Infected surfaces
The virus can be found from a surface that has been infected or sneezed by a person with the virus.
The virus can be present in droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces.
If you lay your hand on your eyes, nose or mouth, you could also get the virus.
This is why it is important to wash your hands properly and often.
How long the virus can survive
Simple household disinfectants can kill the virus on surfaces.
Clean the surface first, and then use a disinfectant.
The crown virus can survive for:
Up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel.
Less than 4 hours on copper
Less than 24 hours on cardboard
Airborne transmission
Airborne transmission is the spread of viruses in very small water particles.
This can happen over a distance longer than droplets, such as across a room.
Airborne transmission does not appear to play a major role in the spread of covid-19.
But it can happen in some cases.
To protect yourself, keep indoor spaces well ventilated (allowing fresh air in) by opening windows and doors if possible.
How to protect yourself
A face mask can protect you, but you should always do what is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
These include:
Social separation
Cover your cough and sneeze.
Wash your hands properly
Do not place your hands near your eyes, nose or mouth unless they are clean
The virus can quickly spread in a crowded environment.
Avoid crowded places as much as possible.
Leave a place if it is crowded and you cannot stay 2 meters away from others.
Pets and the crown virus
There is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs can spread the coronavirus among humans.
To give yourself better protection, wash your hands often and adequately when in contact with pets.
Face mask, medical mask and disposable gloves
You are required by law to wear face cover
Public transport.
In shops, shopping centres etc - see complete list
Face cover should also be worn:
When it is not possible to stay away 2 meters from others
In hospitals, doctor's dispensary, nursing homes and at the dentist and other health centers
When people are at risk from people who are at greater risk from the coronary virus - eg people over 70 years of age or people who are vulnerable to health
There are people who should not / cannot wear face cover.
Here is a piece of cloth that covers your nose and mouth.
This coverage may restrict the spread of the coronavirus in the community.
It may help to prevent the spread of the coronavirus from sneezing or coughing in people with the virus.
They may help people who do not know they have the virus to pass on the virus to others.
Social separation
Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve when coughing and sneezing.
Wash your hands often and adequately
Do not place your hands near your eyes, nose or mouth unless they are clean.
People who should not wear face cover
You do not need to wear a mask if you have an illness or particular needs and a facial covering may upset or make you uncomfortable.
Facial coverage is also not recommended for people with:
They have trouble breathing
Unconscious person or speech
A person who is unable to remove the face cover without assistance,
A person with special needs or hearing difficulties, or who is deaf
In such cases, the person will receive some protection from the cheater if he is able to throw cheaters.
But this is the only time you should spend on cells.
You will get better protection against covid-19 if you wear a cloth-covered face cover.
Children under the age of 13 are not advised to wear face masks, but some children may choose to wear one.
There is a good chance that young children will not follow the advice on how to wear face masks properly.
There is also a risk that they may not understand the importance of avoiding touching the cover.
Children under 13 should wear a mask if recommended by their doctor or health worker.
Children may be advised to wear a mask while attending a hospital clinic for example.
Children under 13 only in the first year of secondary school should wear face cover while attending school.
This is recommended because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can properly follow the advice on face coverings.
When one should wear
You must wear face cover on public transport, by law and in:
Shops and pharmacy
Shopping centers
Libraries
Cinemas
Theaters
Concert halls
Bingo halls
Museums
Nail salon
Hairdressers and barbers
Tattoo shop and piercing

Laundry centers and dry cleaners
Bookmakers
Many of these places are temporarily closed due to health risk to the public.
When you can remove the face cover
You can remove the face cover to
Talk to someone who has communication difficulties
Providing emergency assistance or care to a vulnerable person
Taking medication
You may be asked to remove the face cover to confirm your age or identity
You can also remove the face cover:
At a post office, credit union or bank
In a restaurant or cafe while eating and drinking
When you are receiving medical or dental treatment
Where it is made from
A face cover is made of cloth such as cotton or silk.
You can buy them or make them at home from items like scarves, t-shirts, fitness shirts, or towels.
How you wear a face cover
It should cover the nose and be under the chin and:
That it lies quietly and comfortably on the cheek

There should be at least 2 pieces of cloth
Be able to catch your breath with ease
How to store and wash face covers
Store your face cover made of cloth properly and wash it regularly to keep it clean.
Have more than one face cover, so you have a clean one if needed.
Remove it properly and clean or disinfect your hands after handling the face cover '
Storing your face cover
Storing wet or dirty face cover
If your face gets wet or dirty due to sweat, saliva, make-up or anything else, put the face cover in a tightly closed bag, and then wash it.
Wash the wet or dirty face cover as soon as possible before it becomes rotten.
Breathing through a wet face cover is not easy to breathe and is not as effective as a dry cover.
Storing dry face cover
A clean face cover can be placed safely until you have to put it on again.
Remove it properly and clean or disinfect your hands after handling it.
Keep it in a dry bag to let air through (bag made of paper or cloth) to keep it clean.
When you put it on again, keep the same side outside.
The more frequent handling of the face cover without washing it, the greater the risk of contamination.
When you remove the face cover to eat or drink something in a safe place such as your pocket, purse or paper bag.
Clean and disinfect your hands after removing the face mask.
Put on the face cover again after eating and keep the same outside.
Clean and disinfect your hands again after applying the face mask.
Washing your face cover

You do not need to sterilize face masks.
Wash it in a washing machine or by hand as you would with other clothes.
If you are using a washing machine.
Add your face covers to your regular wash
Use a regular laundry detergent and set the temperature for the type of fabric present
If you are washing by hand
Wash your face cover with water and fabric detergent or soap
Rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove the detergent or soap again
Fog on your glasses
There may be fog on your glasses when you wear the face cover.
The warm air from your breath passes out through the surface of the face cover.
This can cause fog on your glasses and make you unable to see correctly.
Cleaning your glasses will not cause as much fog.
Before you put on the face cover:
Clean your glasses with water and soap.
Shake them to remove the water from them.
Leave the glasses to air dry or dry them with a clean cloth.
Make sure the face cover is well compressed
The face cover will stop the fog on your glasses if you put them on correctly.
It doesn ’ t have to be uncomfortable but be perfectly squeezed with no gap around your nose.
Place your glasses over the face cover seal to keep your breath away from your glasses.
You may not be able to set your face cover long up enough on your face to do this..
If not, try sticking the face cover under your glasses with tape.
How to make one
To make a cloth cover at home:
Cut two tightly woven cotton rectangles, about 25cm x 15cm.
Fold and sew upper and lower edges.
Fold and sew the edges to the side, leaving a gap large enough to pass elastic.
Insert elastic 15cm long through the side edges and tie them tightly.
A hair ribbon or twine cut long enough to tie behind the head will work.
Fix the elastic knots inside the edges of the mask and grip if you need a neat finish.
How long will it last
Facial coverage should be removed when:
It no longer covers the nose and mouth
Which are ribbon, elastic, or straps stretched or damaged
He can't stay on the front
Holes in the cloth or if it is torn
How to use the face cover properly
Clean your hands properly before applying it.
Practice using it so that you are comfortable wearing and removing it.
Make sure it is made of a cloth that you are comfortable with
Cover your mouth and nose and make sure there are no gaps.
Tie it securely.
Carry clean face covers in a sealed bag that is waterproof.
Carry another similar bag to put used covers.
Do not touch your face cover when wearing it - if it does, clean your hands properly.
Do not use a wet or dirty face cover.
Do not share your face cover with others.
Don't take off your face cover for talking, eating and / or waving - if you need to expose your nose or mouth, take off the cover and put it in your used cover bag.
Do not throw away your face covers in public places.
Removing your reusable face cover
To properly remove the face cover:
Remove it from the back of your head - do not lay your hand on the piece in front of your face
Put it in a sealed bag that is watertight or wash it immediately - put disposable masks in a bin immediately
Clean your hands properly
Masks of any use
How to safely dispose of a disposable mask:
Remove it from the back of your head - do not touch the front of the mask
Throw it away immediately in a closed bin
Clean your hands with an alcohol-based disinfectant or soap and water
Throw in the general bin at home or work, or in a bin if you are out
Do not throw them in the recycling bin as they cannot be recycled
Take them home if you don't have a bin - don't throw them away on the street.
Cheat and face shield
Cells are not the best option for protecting you and others from covid-19.
They can stop some of the droplets from your mouth or nose from spreading and it is better not to throw anything away.
But you should only wear cheaters if you are ill or weakened and have difficulty wearing a face mask.
The cellulite should cover the sides of your face (from ear to ear) and down under your chin.
Reusable cells should always be cleaned after wear and kept in a clean place until you need them again.
You should wear a mask if
You have the coronavirus, if you think you have the virus or are waiting for a test result
You are caring for someone who has or is suspected of having the crown virus
You are waiting for yourself and if you can't stay 2 meters away from other people in the house
Facial cover with valve or ventilator
A face cover with a valve or vent does not protect you from covid-19
Do not wear a face cover with valves or a fan.
The face covers are not good enough to stop the spread of the virus as you could breathe in or out of the virus through the valve or through the ventilator.
They are usually used by construction workers or artisans for dust protection.
They are not designed to prevent the spread of viruses.
Medical mask
The medical mask is for these people;
Health care workers
People who are self-isolated and cannot stay 2 meters away from others in their own home
They are also used by other workers in specific positions.
These masks are very important and are not for the general public unless a person is self-isolated and cannot stay 2 meters away from others in their home.
Wear a cloth-covered face mask when shopping and on public transport.
This will ensure that the medical masks are available to those who need them.
Disposable gloves
Do not wear disposable gloves instead of washing your hands.
The virus stays on them in the same way it stays on your hands.
Also, the virus can spread to your hands when you touch them.
Disposable gloves are worn in medical settings.
They are not as effective in everyday life.
Wearing disposable gloves may make you feel safe but this is not the case
Sneezing or coughing into gloves - this creates a new surface on which the virus can survive
Give yourself the virus when you take off your gloves or lay a hand on some surface
Not washing your hands as often as necessary and putting the contaminated gloves on your face how to wash your hands properly and avoid infection
How to clean your hands
Cleaning your hands will help control the spread of bacteria and viruses that cause infections.
Hundreds of people become ill every day in ireland from associated healthcare infections.
You could get a serious illness, even death, with these infections.
The best way to stop harmful germs from spreading is by cleaning your hands.
About 30% to 50% of infections that start in hospitals can be avoided.
Clean your hands
Use soap and water or alcohol hand gel to clean your hands regularly.
Hand disinfectants contain alcohol and are extremely flammable.
Do not use them near heat or fire.
How to wash your hands with soap and water
Wet your hands with warm water and soap.
Rub your hands together until foam is formed.
Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingers.
Do this for about 20 seconds.
Clean your hands under running water.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.
If you have dry skin or a problem with your skin, use a moisturizer after washing your hands and at night.
Hand hygiene at home
Make sure you wash your hands when you are at home and not in hospital:
After you use the toilet
When you clean up after your pet
Before preparing food, before handling food or before a meal
After dealing with raw meat
After using public transport
When you return home after meeting a lot of people
Cleaning your hands will help you avoid:
Colds and flu
Stomach aches such as norovirus diarrhea
Eye infections such as conjunctivitis
Bullfrogs such as mrsa and vre
Children often have these infections, parents and childcare workers should always make sure that children clean their hands regularly.
Hand hygiene in health care centres
Patients
If you are a patient with an infection, the staff will support you and tell you how to control the spread of bacteria (germs).
Follow all the instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse to help keep your infection under control.
The best way to avoid and prevent infection is to:
Clean your hands often
Do not forget to clean your hands properly after going to the toilet and before a meal
Use your own soap, flannel, sponge and razor
Do not share newspapers or anything personal with other patients
Restrict any contact with patients and stay out of bed
Tell staff if the facilities at the hospital or clinic are not clean
You are less likely to spread 'germs' at home.
But you should always keep your hands and toilet clean.
Visitors
If you are visiting a patient, clean your hands when you enter and leave the ward.
If you are making a long visit or helping a patient, clean your hands regularly while you are there.
You can use soap and water or alcohol gel available at the hospital / health center.
If there is any dirt on your hands or under your fingers, you will need to use soap and water.
You can then ensure that they are properly cleaned by using alcohol gel.
Vaccine
A vaccine reduces infections and protects you and your family.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if your child has had all the appropriate injections.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should get this year's flu vaccine or a vaccine to protect you from pneumonia.
This is especially important for the elderly or those with long-term health illnesses.
Stop smoking during the coronary virus outbreak
Do you already have a stop plan (quit)? Sign in
If you smoke, you are at greater risk of developing an acute respiratory infection such as the flu.
Smokers are at greater risk of getting the flu and getting a worse infection than non - smokers.
Although it is a new virus, it is now clear that people are also at risk from the coronavirus, because they smoke.
Like the flu, coronary virus may be worse for smokers,
If you smoke, you do not need self-isolation unless you have symptoms.
But you should follow the same advice as everyone else: Stay home and protect yourself from the crown virus.
This is a good time to quit smoking.
Stopping smoking will strengthen your natural defenses against all types of infections, including the coronavirus.
When you stop, the hairs in your airways (cilia) will start working again.
Within a day or two, the oxygen levels in your body will improve.
Your blood pressure and pulse will decrease, which will reduce the stress on your body.
Each of these will give you protection against the coronavirus.
How tobacco harms you
Weaker heart and lungs
Smoking affects the way your heart and lungs work, making it less easy for you to fight off an acute infection, such as the flu or the coronary virus.
Cigarette smoke damages the natural barriers to infection in the lungs, making it easier for the virus to attach to the surface of your lung and cause infection of the lung tissues.
Laying a hand on your face
The coronary virus is spread in sneezing or coughing drops, it has to go from the infected nose or mouth and into your own eyes, nose or mouth to infect you.
This can happen directly or indirectly (on hands, objects, surfaces).
Everyone is advised not to lay a hand on their face.
But when you smoke, chances are you put your hands on your face, especially your mouth.
This increases the risk of infection.
Protect yourself and others from coronavirus
Don ’ t be too close to others
Social separation is important to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.
This is done by restricting contact between potentially infected people and healthy people.
You should stay 2 meters (6.5 feet) away from others.
People tend to be close to others when they are smoking.
Quitting smoking will reduce the risk of infection.
Social separation
Sharing cigarettes
Good hygiene and handwashing are very important at the present time.
The advice of public health doctors is that we should not share things that come into our mouths, such as bottles or cups.
Cigarettes should therefore not be shared with others.
Good hygiene and hand washing.
Smoke from other people's cigarettes
Smoking indoors puts your closest people at risk because your second-hand smoke interferes with the body's natural defences to fight infections such as coronavirus.
Children in particular are at risk of second-hand smoke because they breathe faster, and their lungs, airways and immune system are still developing.
The best way to avoid this and to protect others is to quit smoking.
Get advice on how to do this from the online quit supports, get started on a personal quitplan plan or join us on facebook.

Ordinary cold
Signs of the cold
The first sign of a cold is a sore throat.
Then comes a sneezing or stuffy, sick or thoughtful nose.
One in three people who catch a cold usually have a cough and feel sick.
A cold is caused by a virus.
Antibiotics will not cure viruses.
Water disappears from the body when a person sweats or sneezes.
Therefore, it is important to drink plenty of fluids.
Take a break and eat healthily.
Do not ask your doctor for antibiotics when you have a cold.
You usually feel worse for 2-3 days before you gradually start to recover.
The symptoms of illness usually last for a week.
Cold symptoms are very similar to the symptoms of the flu, but the flu is much more serious.
Cold
It comes to you gradually
You usually feel it in your nose and throat
You feel sick but you are able to continue as normal - for example, going to work
Flu
It comes to you quickly within a few hours
You usually feel it in your nose and throat

Signs of the cold:
A stuffy or smoky nose
Sore throat
Headache
Muscle pains
Cough

Adults and children have the same symptoms.
Sometimes the symptoms last longer in children.
Causes of the cold
A cold is caused by a virus.
They spread easily among people.
You become contagious until all the symptoms are gone.
This usually takes about a week.
Coughing and sneezing spreads germs that can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
To reduce the spread of a cold, do the following:
Wash your hands with warm water and soap
Cough into your elbow to make sure you don't spread germs on your hands or others
Use a tissue to catch the germs when you cough or sneeze
Throw the paper towel in the bin as soon as possible
How to avoid colds
The best ways to avoid colds are:
Wash your hands with warm water and soap, especially before meals.
Do not share towels or cups with a cold
Do not touch your eyes or nose.
You could get yourself infected if you have the virus.
Keep exercising and stay healthy
The flu vaccine protects against the flu but not the cold.
Treatment
Most colds can be treated at home.
You will recover without any special treatment.
Drink plenty of fluids, take a break and eat healthy food.
Continue as usual when you recover.
Talk to your pharmacist about the products and medicines that will help you.
Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken to relieve pain or fever.
A nasal spray helps to open a stuffy nose.
You may also find relief with throat sprays, lotions and cough treatments.
Be careful about taking medicines for coughs and colds if you are also taking paracetamol or ibuprofen.
That way, you could take more than the recommended dose.
There are some medications that are not suitable for children, infants and pregnant women.
Get advice from your pharmacist.
There is little evidence that nutritional supplements such as vitamin c, zinc, echinacea or garlic help to heal.
Visit your gp:
If your symptoms of illness do not improve after 3 weeks
If you have difficulty breathing or have chest pain
If your illness symptoms suddenly get worse
If you have a very high temperature or you feel very hot, and you are shaking
If you are worried about your child's symptoms of illness
If you have a long-term illness - for example, if you have diabetes, heart, lung, kidney or neurological disease
If you have a weakened immune system - for instance, if you have diabetes or are receiving chemotherapy
Antibiotics
Antibiotics will not do you any good for your symptoms of illness, and you will not recover faster.
Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections.
Colds are a virus.
Shortness of breath
Shortness of breath may not be a concern but sometimes it can be serious and may require treatment.
You may have a heart attack or a problem with your lungs or airways.
Call a gp if you have shortness of breath:
Which lasted longer than a month
Which gets worse when you are active
Which gets worse when you lie down
You have been coughing for 3 weeks or more
That your ankles are swollen
Shortness of breath combined with high temperature may be a sign of the coronary virus.
If you have these symptoms you should call your gp.
It is important to seek medical advice to ensure that it is not serious.
You are not wasting anyone 's time checking it out.
Causes shortness of breath
There are many different causes of shortness of breath.
The most common causes include a common cold or chest, asthma, being overweight or a smoker.
It can also be a sign of a panic attack.
But sometimes it can be a sign of something more serious, such as lung cancer or the lung disease known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).
Any treatment you need will depend on what is causing your symptoms.
Don't try to self-diagnose - always consult a gp.
Contact tracking
Contact tracking identifies people who have had close contact with someone with the coronary virus.
This is being done to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the community.
The people who do this work are called “contact trackers ”.
If you get a positive result
If you get a positive result the contact tracker will call you to find the contact details of anyone you have been in close contact with.
If you test positive only covid-19 signals you
They will ask you about the people and places you visited 48 hours before your illness counterparts began and you began to self-isolate.
If you test positive but do not have covid-19 symptoms
The contact tracker will only ask you about people and places you visited 24 hours before your test and until you started self-isolation.
They won ’ t ask you about people who passed by on the street or in shops.
There is little danger in such situations, especially if you are practising social separation.
Contact tracking is confidential.
No-one who calls the contact administrator will know that you provided their contact details.
Covid tracker app
The contact tracker will also ask you if you have used the covid tracker app
If you have been using it, they will ask you to use the upload function again to send an alert to your immediate contacts.
You do this with the app.
It is your choice to do this.
If you consent, a separate upload code will be sent to you with a text message.
This code will release the lock on the app's upload function.
Dehydration
Your body loses more fluid than it absorbs when you are dehydrated.
This can be serious for you if you do not get medical treatment.
Children and people over 65 are at greater risk of dehydration.
You are more likely to become dehydrated if you have symptoms of flu or coronavirus.
Signs of dehydration
Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:
Tart
Dark yellow urine with a strong odor
Dizziness or confusion
Feeling tired
Dry mouth, lips and eyes
Little urine, and less than four times a day
Dehydration can occur more easily in the following situations:
High temperatures of 38 degrees celsius or above you
Diabetes
Vomiting or diarrhea
Spending too much time in the sun (heat stroke)
If you drink too much alcohol
Sweating a lot after exercise
Urinating more often due to medication you are taking (diuretics)
Reduce the risk of dehydration
Drink liquids when you feel any sign of dehydration.
If you can ’ t drink easily because you feel sick or if you were sick, start with small bubbles and then drink more bulbs, gradually.
You can use a spoon to help your child swallow the liquid.
You should drink enough throughout the day so that your urine has a clear light color.
Drink a drink if you are at risk of dehydration.
For example, if you are sneezing, sweating or have diarrhea.
Caregivers: Make sure the person in your care drinks enough
The person you care for may not realize that he / she is not drinking enough fluids.
To help them:
Make sure they drink during meal time
Make it a social habit, like "drinking a cup of tea"
Give them plenty of water - such as soup, ice cream or jelly, or fruit like melons
A pharmacist can help with dehydration
If you are vomiting or have diarrhea and are losing too much fluid, you need to replace the sugar, salts and minerals lost by your body.
Your pharmacist may recommend oral rehydration pouches.
This is a powder that you mix with water and then drink it.
Ask your pharmacist which ones are best for you or your child.
When to seek medical help
Contact your gp if your symptoms do not improve with treatment and:
You are feeling more tired than usual
You are confused and upset
You have dizziness that does not go away when you stand up
You did not urinate during the day
Your pulse is weak or fast
You have seizures
These are signs of severe dehydration that urgently require medical treatment.
Dehydration in children
Children under five with dehydration
Children under 5 should drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Dehydration is common in young children.
This can be serious if not dealt with quickly.
Contact your gp urgently if your child:
Sleepy
Breathing fast
When your child is crying they have no tears or a few tears
Fontanelle pressed in (the soft spot on the child's head)
Dry mouth
Dark yellow urine or no urine for the last 12 hours
Cold hands and feet or a stained appearance
Once the dehydration has been treated, your baby will need to drink plenty of fluids.
Continue breastfeeding or using formula milk - try to feed a little more often than usual
Give small bubbles of water to children who are on formula or dry food
Give small children the normal diet
Give a small drop of the rehydrated solution regularly to make sure they get the lost liquid, salts and sugars, - ask your pharmacist to suggest one
Don't
Do not make the formula weaker.
Don't give young children fruit juice or fizzy drinks - it makes diarrhea or diarrhea worse.
Coronavirus - treatment
There is no specific treatment available for coronavirus.
But 80% of people will be able to recover from the coronary virus at home and will not need to go into hospital.
The vaccines will be available in stages and as a result it will take some time to vaccinate the population.
If you experience symptoms, you should self-isolated to prevent the spread of covid-19.
Call your gp or out of hours service immediately to discuss your symptoms and to determine if you need to have a covid-19 test.
The most important thing is to protect others from the virus.
Protecting those in at-risk groups from covid-19 is crucial.
Self-isolation
Get enough sleep and rest time
Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
Your urine should be bright yellow or bright
Eat healthily
Do not smoke
Fan you
Keep an eye out for signs of illness and treat them

Read all the guidelines in the package before taking any medication.
Take advice from any health professional.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics do not work against covid-19 or any other viruses.
They will not give you relief from your symptoms of illness or help you to recover.
Covid-19 is a virus that is not helped by antibiotics.
Iobuprofen
It is okay to take anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) if you have covid-19.
There is no evidence that it is dangerous.
Only take one anti-inflammatory medication at a time.
It is okay to take paracetamol and anti-inflammatory medications such as iobuprofen together.

All the knowledge about covid-19 can be redundant for us.
It may worry you for no reason.
If so, choose a specific time each day or every second day to get the most important information.
Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between facts and rumors.
Get your information from reliable and reliable sources.
People talk about their worries or express personal opinions about covid-19 on social media.
This may add to your anxiety and worry.
It is important to make a careful choice about who you contact on social media and how much time you spend on social media.
If you feel that all the talk about the coronavirus is too much for you, talk to someone close to you about it or get help.
Keep doing the usual things
The coronary virus outbreak can affect what you do every day in different ways.
But it would be better for you if you could have some kind of structure to your day in these turbulent worlds.
It is important to pay attention to your own needs and feelings in this stressful time, especially.

Rphost
Social media
Video calls
Phone calls
Text messaging
Video calls can be made to many people at the same time on different video apps.
Talking to others will reduce your anxiety and worry.
You don ’ t have to pretend to be strong or be able to handle everything alone

It is understandable that you would feel vulnerable or under pressure after reading or hearing news about the outbreak.
Identify these feelings.
Remind yourself and others to take care of their physical and mental health.

This will not help you in the long run.
Eating habits are often related to your emotions.
You may eat food to get relief during a coronary virus outbreak.
Eating for relief can cause you to gain weight and impair your health.
It is important to distinguish between your mood and the amount of food you eat.
If you already have mental health difficulties and are using the mental health services
If the horseshoe falls on the nail, it will help you if you have a plan in place.
Things you could do:
Prepare a list of phone numbers for mental health services, relatives and friends that you can call if you need help
Keep taking any medicines and collect your prescription with the help of your doctor or psychiatrist
Continue with any counseling or psychotherapy sessions you have
Cut back on the time you spend listening to the news and use no phone but a reliable source
Practice relaxation techniques and breathing exercises
If things get worse, contact your mental health team or gp.
If you have an intellectual disability
If you have an intellectual disability, you may feel more anxious or sad about the covid-19.
You may also be worried about your family or those close to you.

You have to decide what is best for your own health.
But certain things should continue to protect you from the crown virus and stay safe.

If you have no work, or less work than before
Your employer may have closed their business and sent you home.
Where this is temporary, this is called a temporary layoff.
If it is permanent, you may be made redundant.
Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme
Your employer may be able to continue to pay you under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and if so, you do not need to apply for a social welfare payment.
You cannot apply for EWSS yourself, it is administered by Revenue through your employer’s payroll.
The EWSS replaced the COVID19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on 1 September 2020.
If you were getting a Working Family Payment, this will continue while you are being paid under the EWSS.
COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment
The COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is for employees and selfemployed people living in Ireland who have lost their employment due to COVID19.
If you lost your job for another reason, you can apply for a jobseeker’s payment.
You can get PUP if you are on a temporary layoff from employment, or if you have been made redundant.
PUP is available to any registered employee or selfemployed worker who has lost all of their work because of COVID19 and is resident in Ireland.
This includes people on student visas and asylum seekers.
If you have dependents, you may get a higher payment by applying for a jobseeker’s payment.
You must be genuinely seeking work to qualify for PUP.
Jobseeker’s Allowance and Jobseeker’s Benefit
If you have lost your job and have dependents, you may get a higher payment if you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) or Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) instead of PUP.
This is because PUP does not pay anything extra for dependents.
A dependent can be your spouse or partner if they are earning less than €350 per week, or children under 18, or under 22 and in full time education.
If you were selfemployed, you can claim Jobseeker’s Benefit (SelfEmployed) instead of JB.
Rates for adult dependents have increased temporarily.
See 'adult dependent increases' below for more details.
JB is based on your PRSI contributions.
JA is means tested.
You apply for both payments at the same time and the Department decides which one you qualify for.
If the number of days you work have decreased, you may be entitled to Short Time Work Support.
You must be unemployed for 3 days per week (excluding Sunday) to qualify for this.
You can get this even if your employer is paying you through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).
If your hours have been reduced but you continue to work for more than 3 days per week (for example, you have been asked to work 5 mornings per week), you may qualify for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.
Family payments
If you are parenting alone you may be entitled to OneParent Family Payment.
The other parent of your child may have reduced the maintenance they pay to support your child.
You should notify your local Intreo centre in this case.
You can get an increase to your payment for up to 12 weeks.
After this, you payment will be reassessed.
You should also check if you qualify for Working Family Payment if you have dependent children and your hours or pay have been reduced.
If you are pregnant and getting PUP or being paid through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), you can still apply for Maternity Benefit, Parent's Benefit and Paternity Benefit.
The time you spend on PUP or being paid through TWSS or EWSS is treated the same as a period of employment.
If you are receiving PUP and have not returned to work before you are due to start your maternity leave, you should ask your GP to complete form MB3 (pdf).
Asking for a review of your payment
If you work and also get a social welfare payment, and your hours or income from work have decreased, you can ask for your payment to be reassessed.
If you lose all of your work, you can apply for PUP.
You can continue to get both Working Family Payment and OneParent Family Payment with your PUP.
If you cannot work because you are sick
If you are ill with COVID19, you can get a special form of enhanced Illness Benefit for COVID19 absences.
You can claim this payment if:
You are diagnosed with COVID19 or
You are suspected of having COVID19 and have been told to selfisolate or restrict your movements by a doctor or the HSE
You must be in employment or selfemployment to qualify.
If you have been told to selfisolate or restrict your movements, you will get Illness Benefit for COVID19 absences for 2 weeks.
If you have been diagnosed with COVID19, you will get up to 10 weeks of the payment.
If you do not qualify for Illness Benefit for COVID19 absences, you may be able to receive Supplementary Welfare Allowance instead.
Illness Benefit for COVID19 absences is paid from the first day of sickness.
If you cannot attend work due to illness that is not COVID19, or if you cannot go to work because you are cocooning, you can apply for standard Illness Benefit.
If your income is a mix of social welfare and pay from employment, you can continue to get your usual social welfare payment if you become sick or have to selfisolate.
If your income is less than the rate of enhanced Illness Benefit you would get, you can apply to have your income topped up to this rate.
This top up will not affect the other payments.
If you work in the civil and public sector, you do not need to apply for Illness Benefit for COVID19 absences as separate leave arrangements are in place.
If you cannot work because you have to look after children
If you cannot go to work because you have to look after your children, your employer may be able to continue to pay you under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.
The Government has asked employers to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff time off to look after their children or other members of their families.
If you left work to care for a child or another member of your family, you can get information and advice on the social welfare payments that may be available to you.
Contact your local Citizens Information Centre or the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0761 07 4000.
You can also contact the Department of Social Protection using MyWelfare or call 1890 800 024.
If you plan to take a holiday
If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment or the COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, you can go on holiday on the island of Ireland (this includes Northern Ireland) for up to 2 weeks and get your payment on your return.
The Government advises that you should not travel abroad except for essential reasons, for example, a bereavement or urgent family business.
If you cannot pay your rent
If you are having difficulty paying rent, you may be able to claim:
Rent Supplement or
Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
Rent Supplement is a shortterm income support to people in the private rented sector who are finding it difficult to pay their rent.
Rent Supplement means assessments have changed to allow for the higher rates of payments that claimants get with PUP and enhanced Illness Benefit.
This applies for applications lodged between 13 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.
You can read more about how Rent Supplement is assessed.
You may be able to get HAP from your local authority if you are assessed as having a housing need.
You have to apply to your local authority’s housing section to be included on the housing list.
It is based on your means and is paid directly to your private landlord.
Going back to work
If you are returning to work you must close your COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) claim.
You can do this is on MyWelfare.ie.
If you are returning to work and your hours have been reduced, you may be entitled to keep or claim another social welfare payment:
Short Time Work Support if you will work 3 days or fewer
Working Family Payment if you have dependent children and will work more than 38 hours per fortnight
Supplementary Welfare Allowance if you work more than 3 days (for example, you work 5 mornings) and are earning less than the basic social welfare rate for your family size
Rent Supplement based on your means
All of the above, except for Short Time Work Support, depend on how much you earn from your employment.
Social welfare options when returning to work are described in more detail in our section on social welfare payments and work.
Collecting your social welfare payment
If you are unable to collect your payment from the post offices due to illness or selfisolation, you can:
Leave your social welfare payment at the post office until you can collect it yourself.
Your payment will be in the post office for at least 20 days after you were first due to collect it.
Nominate a temporary Agent to collect your payment.
You can get a form for appointing a temporary Agent on the An Post website (pdf).
Apply to transfer your payment to your financial institution using form DIR PMT1 (pdf).
Your social welfare payment can be paid directly into your personal account at a bank, building society or at certain credit unions.
You can use your expired Public Services Card for ID when collecting your social welfare payment.
PRSI contributions
If you are getting the COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or you are being paid under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, when you apply for social insurance payments (for example, Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and the State Pension (Contributory), you will be treated as if you have been paying insurance contributions based on the social insurance class you were paying before you stopped working.

Your employment rights during COVID19
This page gives an overview of the protections for employees during COVID19 and the supports you may be entitled to.
If you are worried about returning to work
If your employer has no work for you, or less work than usual
If your employer has closed their business during COVID19 restrictions and sent you home, this is called a temporary layoff.
During lay off you remain an employee even if you are not being paid.
Find out more about layoff and short time working.
Employers can use the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to help them with some of the costs of paying wages.
This means that workers retain their link with employers and they do not need to personally submit a jobseeker's claim.
If your employer cannot pay you and you have lost all your employment, you should apply for the COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.
If your employer reduces your hours to 3 days or less per week from your normal fulltime hours, you can apply for a payment called Short Time Work Support which is a form of Jobseeker’s Benefit.
Your employer can also put you on shorttime working which is a more formal procedure and applies where, due to a reduction in the amount of work to be done, either:
Your weekly pay is less than half your normal weekly pay or
The hours you work are reduced to less than half your normal weekly working hours
Annual leave and public holidays during lay off or shorttime working
During lay off or shorttime working, you are still employed by your employer and your contract of employment remains in force.
This means that you are entitled to benefit for any public holidays that occur during the first 13 weeks of lay off.
You do not accrue annual leave during lay off but you are entitled to take annual leave that you accrued before being laid off.
Changes to redundancy rules during COVID19
The law on claiming redundancy from your employer if you have been temporarily laid off, or temporarily put on shorttime work has changed during the COVID19 emergency period.
Normally, if you are laid off or put on shorttime hours, you can claim redundancy from your employer after 4 weeks or more, or 6 weeks in the last 13 weeks.
If you were put on lay off or shorttime hours because of COVID19, you cannot claim redundancy.
This is set out in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID19) Act and applies from 13 March 2020.
If you are sick or have been asked to self isolate
If you are showing symptoms of COVID19, you should not go to work.
You should contact your GP for advice.
COVID19 symptoms are explained on the HSE website.
If you are sick with COVID19, you may be entitled to sick pay from your employer.
This depends on your contract of employment.
Your employer does not have to pay you when you cannot come to work because you are sick with COVID19, unless it is part of your contract of employment.
If your employer does not pay you, you should apply for COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.
If you have to care for someone
If you are not sick, but you cannot go to work because you have to care for a child or other relative, you can ask for paid leave.
If your employer cannot give you paid leave, you can ask for statutory leave.
Statutory means that the leave is set out in law, for example, your right to parental leave.
Paid compassionate leave
Employers have been asked to be as flexible as possible in assisting employees with care arrangements during the pandemic.
This could include:
Offering paid compassionate leave
Allowing you to work from home
Altering your shifts, so that you can coordinate caring between you and your partner, or another person.
Allowing you to rearrange holidays
Allowing you to take paid time off that you can work back at a later time
Statutory leave
If none of the options above are available to you, and you cannot arrange for paid leave from your employer, you can apply for one of the statutory schemes below.
Force majeure leave (this is paid leave)
Parental leave if you are looking after a child up to the age of 12 (or 16 if the child has a disability)
Parent’s leave if you are caring for a child up to aged 2 who was born after 1 November 2019
You are allowed to take 3 days force majeure leave in a 12month period, or 5 days in a 36 month period.
You can ask your employer to allow you to take the full 5 days paid force majeure leave together.
You normally give your employer 6 weeks’ notice if you want to take parental or parent’s leave, but you can ask your employer to waive this notice period.
Your employer does not have to pay you when you are on parental or parent’s leave.
If you are on parent’s leave you can apply for Parent’s Benefit.
If you are on parental leave, you can apply for meanstested Supplementary Welfare Allowance.
You can read more about the childcare supports for parents in our page on childcare and COVID19.
If you are pregnant
Our page Social welfare payments and COVID19 has information about your social welfare options if you are pregnant and have been laid off or made unemployed.
You can read about pregnancy and coronavirus and you can read information for pregnant women on COVID19 from the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin.
This information is available in 5 languages.
School and COVID19
Children attending school
Your child should not attend school if they are displaying any symptoms of COVID19.
Students at school must keep their physical distance from one another outside of the classroom and work within the classroom in designated groupings or ‘bubbles’.
Schools have introduced:
Increased hand washing and sanitising
Enhanced cleaning regimes
Staggered breaks and lunch times
Rules for children using school transport
Blended learning which mixes learning at school and onlinelearning at home forms part of the school programme so that schools can respond quickly if public health circumstances change.
Schools can arrange classrooms, PE halls and other spaces to maximise school spaces for safe learning.
Schools can manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of students with complex medical needs who may not be able to return to school because public health guidelines indicate they are at “very high risk”.
The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has developed webinars and wellbeing toolkits for primary and postprimary schools to support the school community in the return to school.
Staying safe at school
Guidance and supports for schools is contained in the Department of Education and Skill’s Reopening our schools: The roadmap for the full return to school.
The roadmap contains detailed guidance and supports covering:
School drop off and collection
Hand washing and hygiene
Face coverings
Maintaining physical distancing
Classrooms, bubbles and pods
Play and break times
School drop off and collection
Many schools have staggered drop off and pick up times.
Students should not gather when they arrive
They should go straight to their small designated group or classroom
Parents and staff should maintain a distance of 2 metres.
Walking and cycling to school is encouraged.
Hand washing and hygiene at school
Staff and students should maintain hand hygiene throughout the school day.
Liquid soap and water is provided in school.
Hand sanitiser can be used, however, young children should not have independent use of alcohol gel containers.
Students and staff should wash hands:
On arrival at school
Before eating or drinking
After using the toilet
After playing outdoors
When their hands are physically dirty
When they cough or sneeze
Moving between classes for postprimary students
Read more on control measures to reopening schools safely on gov.ie.
Face coverings
Children under 13 years are not required to wear face coverings.
Teachers and secondary school students must wear face coverings, when a physical distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained.
All Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) must wear face coverings, or in certain situations clear visors in the class room.
Maintaining physical distancing at school
Primary and special schools
Schools have reconfigured spaces to maximise physical distancing.
The classrooms are clear of unnecessary furniture, shelves and material on the walls.
The following physical distancing measures should be followed:
1 metre distance should be maintained between desks or between individual students
The teacher’s desk should be at least 1 metre (where possible 2 metres) away from a student’s desk
Teachers should avoid close contact at face to face level with students
Teachers should maintain a 2 metre distance in staff rooms and staff groups and should wear a face covering where they cannot maintain distance
Where possible desks should consistently be used by the same staff and children.
The roadmap recognises that younger children are unlikely to maintain physical distancing indoors.
Postprimary
At postprimary schools, schools can take a common sense approach to decreasing the contact between students.
The following physical distancing measures should be followed:
Students and teachers should limit their interaction when moving between class, in hallways and other shared areas
Student’s desks should be 2 metre distance apart but at least 1 metre distance from individual students or staff
Teachers should maintain a 2 metre distance in staff rooms and staff
Classrooms, bubbles and pods
Primary school and special schools
Students may be grouped into class ‘bubbles’ and ‘pods’.
A ‘bubble’ is a class grouping which stays apart from other classes as much as possible.
Your child may be in smaller group or ‘pod’ within the class bubble.
Pods and bubbles help limit close contact and sharing of common facilities between students in different pods and bubbles.
While your child is in a class grouping or bubble they mix only with their own class from arrival at school in the morning until they leave at the end of the school day.
There should be at least 1 metre distance between individual pods within the class bubble and between individuals in the pod, whenever possible.
Students and teachers should be consistently in the same class bubble although this will not be possible at all times.
Each class bubble should have separate breaks and meal times or separate areas at break or meal times.
Post primary schools
In addition to reconfiguring class spaces and maximising physical distancing, schools may:
Review timetables
Reconfigure classes
Consider use of live streaming within the school
Use available spaces within the local community
Students should be assigned to a main class cohort, where possible.
They will remain in the classroom for most subjects, with teachers moving between rooms.
Classes are planned to minimise movement during the day.
If your child has an elective subject they should move quickly to the new class and sit with members of their class cohort, while maintaining physical distance.
All students and staff should avoid sharing educational material or personal items such as pens, pencil cases and notebooks.
Contact areas of devices such as keyboards or tablets should be cleaned regularly.
Staff and students should limit meeting in hallways and shared areas.
Hand to hand greetings and hugs should be discouraged.
Where students need to move within the classroom to perform activities or share a resource it should be organised to minimise students meeting at the same time.
Play and break times
Primary schools and special schools, should have staggered breaks and adjust playtime to:
Reduce crowding at the entrances and exits
Keep students in consistent groups when they play together, where it is not possible to maintain physical distancing
Minimise sharing of equipment
Postprimary schools who operate a canteen should:
Make sure physical distancing is applied
Stagger canteen use and extend serving times to align with class groupings (where possible)
Implement a queue management system
If your child becomes unwell at school
You will be contacted immediately
Your child will be accompanied by a staff member to an isolation area away from other staff and students while maintaining at least 2 metres distance
If the isolation area is not a separate room your child will be kept 2 metres away from others in the room
If it is not possible to maintain 2 metre distance, the staff member caring for your child will wear a face covering.
Your child should avoid touching people or surfaces and use a tissue when they cough or sneeze
Your child will be given a face covering to wear if they are in a common area with other people or while exiting the building
Your child will be assessed to see whether they can immediately go home or be brought home by you.
Public transport should not be used.
If your child is well enough to go home, the school will arrange for them to be taken home by a family member and you will be asked to call your doctor.
If your child is too unwell to go home, school staff will contact 999 or 112 and tell them that your child is suspected of having COVID19
Staff and students must follow the protocol for managing a suspected case of COVID19 in school.
When to keep your child home from school
You should not send your child to school if they have:
Symptoms of COVID19
Been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID19
Been living with someone who is unwell and may have COVID19
An existing breathing condition that has recently got worse
Other symptoms such as sore throat, headaches or diarrhoea
Returned from another country in the last 14 days
You can read more about when to keep your child from school and what to do if your child has symptoms on the HSE website.
Read more about how to restrict your movements and selfisolate.
Curriculum for 2021 school year
The curriculum for the 2021 school year at all school levels will take account of the:
Learning experiences of students during the school closure
Likely gaps in learning
Practical context in which teaching and learning will take place in the new school year
The Department has prepared curriculum guidance for primary and postprimary schools.
Schools will reprioritise certain areas of the curriculum and give greater time and attention to areas such as Social, Personal and Health Education, Physical Education, Language and Mathematics.
Schools can decide how to sequence and pace learning for students following their return to school.
The Government has announced adjustments to certificate examinations in 2021.
The changes are set out in the Department of Education’s Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021 and Returning to School Transition Year 2020/21
You can read more about changes to the Junior Cycle, Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Applied and Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.
Supporting students with Special Educational Needs (SEN)
Students with special education needs may need support for their wellbeing or planned learning experiences to take account of the effect of school closures on their progress.
Schools got all records of progress for children who attended July Provision to help them support planning for children’s needs.
Supporting students ‘at very high risk’ of COVID19
Schools will provide additional support for students who are ‘very high risk’ and cannot attend school for health reasons related to COVID19.
The plan continues to use 5 levels of restriction that correspond to the severity of COVID19 in a location.
Level 1 is for locations where COVID19 is the least severe and means that restrictions on the activities of people and businesses are at their lowest level.
Level 5 is for locations where COVID19 is most severe and means that restrictions on the activities of people and businesses are at their highest level.
Level 5 is in place now
Every county in Ireland is currently on Level 5.

On 23 February 2021, the Government introduced a revised plan to manage COVID19 called ‘COVID19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead’.
The plan continues to set out 5 levels of restrictions.
Level 1 has the fewest restrictions and Level 5 has the most.
The level that applies to each county depends on the current COVID19 situation in that county.
For more information on the different levels see Plan for living with COVID19.
Level 5 is in place now
Level 5 restrictions apply to all counties until 5 April 2021.

There are restrictions on travel into Ireland and travel abroad.
See further details on Level 5 restrictions.
Support bubbles
Under Level 5 restrictions, you should not have visitors to your home unless they are part of your support bubble.
A support bubble, also called a paired household or an extended household, is when an isolated person from one household has close contact with one other household.
In a support bubble, the 2 households can meet indoors, even though they do not live together.
There are special rules about who can form a support bubble.
You can only form a support bubble if you:
Live alone
Live alone with children under the age of 18
Share parenting or custody arrangements
Live with an adult you provide care for
Live by yourself and have a carer or carers who support you, including a livein carer
If you are an essential worker and you do not have an existing childcare arrangement, you can form a bubble with another household for childcare.
You can form a support bubble with one other household that is not already part of a support bubble.
Travel restrictions
While Ireland is at Level 5, you should not leave your house, except for exercise within 5 km of your home, unless you have a reasonable excuse.
The following list gives examples of reasonable excuses for leaving your home, as set out in Statutory Instrument 701 of 2020, as amended:

A Garda can give you a fixed charge notice of €100 for travelling without a reasonable excuse.
Mandatory quarantine
By law, you must quarantine when you arrive into Ireland.
It does not apply if your journey starts in Northern Ireland.
Travel abroad
You must only travel abroad if it is essential to do so.
The permitted reasons for travelling abroad are set out in Statutory Instrument 29 of 2021 (pdf).
You can be fined €500 for unnecessary travel abroad.
Emergency legislation
On 20 March 2020, the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 was signed into law.
The Act gives the Minister for Health the power to make regulations to introduce measures to slow down the spread of the virus.
Under this Act, the Minster can make regulations to:
Restrict travel to and from Ireland
Restrict travel within Ireland to stop people moving to and from affected areas
Stop gatherings of people from taking place, and to make organisers of these gatherings put safeguards in place to prevent the virus from spreading
Make businesses (such as shops) put safeguards in place to protect their staff and customers
Close premises, including schools
Laws in place now
The Government continues to issue guidance to help prevent the spread of COVID19.
It has also passed laws that make it an offence to do or not do certain things.
Current restrictions are set out in the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A Temporary Restrictions) (COVID19) (No.
10) Regulations 2020, as amended, which apply until 5 March 2021.
These regulations require all nonessential services and retail outlets to close.
It is an offence to leave your place of residence without a reasonable excuse and you can be fined by a Garda for doing this.
A Garda can also ask you to return to your place of residence if you have left without a reasonable excuse.
Failure to comply with this direction is also an offence.
It is unlawful to host an event in a private home unless it is just for the residents or people in a paired household.
It is also unlawful to go to an event in someone else’s home unless you are part of a paired household.
If you do not comply, it is an offence and you can get a fixed penalty notice or be prosecuted.
Gardaí have the power under the Health (Amendment) Act 2020 to attend at the entrance of any private home where they believe an unlawful gathering is happening and direct any nonresidents to leave it or direct those approaching not to attend.
The following laws apply until 9 June 2021:
You must wear a face covering on public transport unless you have a reasonable excuse for not doing so.
This is set out in the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A – Temporary Restrictions) (COVID19) (Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020, extended by Statutory Instrument 512 of 2020 (pdf).
Statutory Instrument 569 of 2020 requires face coverings in taxis and in bus and rail stations.
You must wear a face covering in shops and other premises that are listed in the regulations, unless you have a reasonable excuse for not doing so.
This is set out in Health Act 1947 (Section 31A Temporary Restrictions) (COVID19) (Face Coverings in Certain Premises and Businesses) Regulations 2020, as amended, which was extended by Statutory Instrument 511 of 2020 (pdf).
You must complete a Passenger Locator Form on or before your arrival in Ireland and tell the authorities if your residence details change within 14 days.
This is set out in the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A – Temporary Requirements) (COVID19 Passenger Locator Form) Regulations 2020, as amended.
International travel
You must complete a Passenger Locator Form on or before your arrival in Ireland and tell the authorities if your residence details change within 14 days.
This is set out in the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A – Temporary Requirements) (COVID19 Passenger Locator Form) Regulations 2021.
You must have proof of a negative COVID19 test (PCR) when you arrive in Ireland from anywhere other than Northern Ireland, unless you are in an exempted category.
The test must have been taken no more than 72 hours before you arrived.
When you arrive, you must show your proof and cooperate with the requests of officials.
If you arrive into Ireland without a PCR test result, you must take a test within 36 hours of your arrival.
It is an offence not to take the test and you can be fined up to €2,500 or receive a prison sentence of up to 6 months, or both.
You must quarantine in the place specified on your passenger locator form for 14 days.
You can stop quarantine if you get a negative PCR test, taken no less than 5 days after arrival.
Stricter rules apply if you have arrived from a high risk 'category 2' country.
You must complete the full 14 days of quarantine.
The quarantine obligation applies if you travel to Ireland through Northern Ireland.
It does not apply if your journey starts in Northern Ireland.
If you do not quarantine, you can be fined up to €2,500 or face 6 months in prison, or both.
There are very limited exceptions where you do not have to complete the quarantine.
These include international transport workers and people travelling for urgent medical reasons.
This is set out in Statutory Instrument 44 of 2021 (pdf) which applies until 5 March 2021.
Detentions and penalties
During COVID19, various regulations have given An Garda Síochána additional powers, including arrest without warrant.
Offences are punishable by a fine of up to €2,500, up to six months imprisonment, or a combination of both.
Fines and fixed penalty notices
For certain offences, you can be fined a fixed amount.
A Garda can give you a fixed penalty notice.
If you do not pay it within 28 days, you can be prosecuted in court.
A Garda can issue the following fixed penalties under the Health Act 1947 (Fixed Payment Notice and Dwelling Event Provisions) (COVID19) Regulations 2020, as amended:
Offence Fixed charge
Not wearing a face covering on public transport, without a reasonable excuse €80

Detention due to health risk
The Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 also allows for detention of someone who is a potential source of infection and risk to public health, if it is necessary to slow the spread of COVID19.
You may be detained if you refuse to stay in a specified place like your home or a hospital, or you cannot be isolated in any other way.
If you are detained, you will be tested as soon as possible and you can ask for a review of your detention by an independent person on the grounds you are not a source of infection.
Failure to comply with a detention, or interfering with the detention of a person is a criminal offence.

Testing for COVID19
To find out if you have COVID19, you must be tested at a special COVID19 test centre or in your home.
Some people may also get a COVID19 test in hospital before they have a hospital procedure.
Who can get tested?
You may be tested for COVID19 if you have developed at least one of these symptoms:
Fever (high temperature)
Cough
Shortness of breath
Loss of taste or smell
You may also be tested if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case (even if you do not have symptoms).
In this case, you will be phoned by a contact tracer who will arrange your appointment for you.
A close contact can be if:
You had facetoface contact within 2 metres of an infected person for more than 15 minutes
You live in the same house or accommodation as an infected person
You sat within 2 seats of an infected person, in any direction, on an airplane
You spent more than 2 hours in a closed space with an infected person, such as an office or a classroom
If you are a close contact, you should restrict your movements for 14 days, even if you receive a negative COVID19 test result.
What to do if you have symptoms of COVID19
If you think you might have COVID19, you should phone your GP.
Do not go to the GP clinic.
If you do not have a GP, you can find a GP in your area.
Your GP will carry out an assessment over the phone.
This assessment is free (including for nonmedical card holders).
If your doctor thinks you need a COVID19 test, they will arrange the test for you.
You will be sent your appointment details by text message (including the exact location and time of your appointment).
If your GP thinks that you do not need a test, you should stay at home until you have had no symptoms for 48 hours.
You should self isolate while waiting for your appointment.
This means that you stay indoors and avoid contact with other people.
The people in your household should restrict their movements.
You can read more about restricted movement and selfisolation.
Getting tested
The test for COVID19 is simple and usually takes about 15 minutes.
If you are medically unable to attend a test centre, you may be tested at home.
If you cannot drive yourself to a test centre, you can ask a family member or friend to drive you.
When you arrive at the test centre, a healthcare worker will:
Confirm your identity and contact details
Give you a face mask to wear
Explain what will happen next
If you are at a drivethru test centre, you will be asked to stay in your car.
A healthcare worker will come to the vehicle and do the test through the window.
The test
You will be asked to blow your nose into a tissue.
This can be thrown into a bin bag provided.
The healthcare worker will then use a swab (similar to a long cotton bud) to take a sample from the back of your throat and nose.
You may feel some discomfort during the swabbing, but it is not painful.
The healthcare worker will send your sample to a lab where it will be tested for COVID19.
Waiting for your results
You should continue to selfisolate while you are waiting for your results.
If you were tested because you are a close contact and do not have symptoms, you should continue to restrict your movements.
You should also make a list of everyone you had close contact with during the 48 hour period before you developed symptoms.
If your results are positive, a ‘contact tracing team’ will ask you for their names and contact details.
Test results
Your test results will be sent to you by text message.
The Health Service Executive (HSE) website explains what your test results mean.
If you had symptoms of COVID19 and do not get a negative test result, you should continue to selfisolate until:
You have had no fever for 5 days and
It has been 10 days since you first developed symptoms (or 14 days if you are in longterm residential care or you recently left hospital after treatment for COVID19)
If you had symptoms of COVID19 and you get a negative test result, you should continue to self isolate until you have not had any symptoms for 48 hours.
You will be tested again 7 days after your last contact with the confirmed case.
If you had to restrict your movements because you recently came to Ireland, you should continue to do so for 14 days, even if you receive a negative COVID19 test result.
You can read more about Returning to Ireland and COVID19 and what to do if you are travelling to Ireland.
If the test results are for a child, you can read about results of a COVID19 test for a child under the age of 13.
Face coverings during COVID19
Wearing a face covering is recommended to help stop the spread of COVID19.
In some situations, wearing a face covering is mandatory, and you could be fined or imprisoned if you refuse to wear one without a reasonable excuse.
You are also strongly recommended to wear a face covering in situations where social distancing is difficult, for example, when visiting people who are cocooning.
This document explains the law on face coverings and gives advice on how to use one safely.
When must I wear a face covering?
Public transport
You must wear a face covering while using public transport.
If you have a reasonable excuse to not wear a face covering, you should tell the driver or inspector.
Read ‘Exceptions’ below for information on reasonable excuses.
Drivers of a public transport vehicle do not have to wear a face covering if they are:
Alone in a compartment
Separated from passengers by a screen
In the vehicle but there are no passengers getting on or off
Shops and other retail settings
Face coverings are mandatory for customers in:
Shops, including pharmacies
Shopping centres
Libraries
Cinemas and cinema complexes
Theatres
Concert halls
Bingo halls
Museums
Nail salons
Hair salons and barbers
Tattoo and piercing parlours
Travel agents and tour operators
Laundries and dry cleaners
Bookmakers
It is also mandatory for retail staff to wear a face covering unless there is a partition or they take all reasonable steps to keep a 2metre distance from others.
You may be asked to remove your face covering to verify your age or identity to staff.
Face coverings are not mandatory in:
Post offices, credit unions or banks
Medical or dental services
Sitin restaurants or cafés
While it is not mandatory to wear a face covering in restaurants, you should wear one when arriving to and leaving your table.
You may be refused entry if you refuse to wear one.
This is for the safety of staff and customers around you.
Fine and penalties
Anyone who does not wear a face covering (or anyone who ignores a request to wear one) without a reasonable excuse may get:
A fine of up to €2,500
Up to 6 months' imprisonment
Both a fine and imprisonment
Face coverings are not recommended for some people, including children under 13.
However, children under 13 may be asked to wear one by a healthcare worker at a doctor’s clinic, hospital or COVID19 testing centre.
Children under 13 should also wear a face covering if they are attending secondary school.
If you have a reasonable excuse to not wear a face covering, you should tell a member of staff.
Reasonable excuses include where you:
Cannot wear a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or a disability, or because it would cause you severe distress
Need to communicate with someone who has difficulties communicating
Remove a face covering to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person or to provide emergency assistance to someone
Remove a face covering to take medication
Remove a face covering to avoid harm or injury
Members of the Garda Síochána do not have to wear a face covering when performing their duties.
What type of face mask should I use?
A face covering (or barrier mask) is not a medical mask, which should be reserved for healthcare professionals.
It is material (usually cotton or linen) that you wear across your nose and mouth using elastic or string.
You can buy a face covering or make a face covering.
Face coverings or barrier masks are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
They are not intended to protect the wearer against viral infection.
Instead, they may prevent the spread of COVID19 to others.
If you are distributing (or buying) face coverings, you should make sure they are produced in line with National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) specifications.
The specifications include:
Clear use of the words ‘barrier mask’
Name and address of the producer
Any warnings or safety information
Instructions for use
When you wear a face covering, you should continue to:
Wash your hands properly and often
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
Keep at least 2 metres from other people
How do I use a face covering?
You should always wash your hands before putting on your face covering (barrier mask).
Avoid touching it while you are wearing it and if you accidently touch the front, wash your hands straight away.
Make sure that the material fully covers your nose and mouth.
You should check that it is tied securely and fits snugly against the side of your face.
Keep your spare face coverings in a clean, waterproof bag (such as a ziplock bag).
You should carry a similar bag for used face coverings.
Label these bags clearly so that you do not mix them up.
If you are a smoker, do not lift up your face covering to smoke.
Instead, remove it completely and place it in your ‘used’ ziplock bag.
When you are removing your face covering, do so using the strings at the back.
Do not touch the front.
If your face covering is disposable, throw it in a bin immediately after use.
If it is reusable, you should wash it in hot water (60 degrees or hotter) with detergent.
Read more about the guidelines for wearing a face covering correctly.
Download posters on the correct use of face coverings in English or Irish.

How long can I get COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit for?
Enhanced Illness Benefit can cover a COVID19 diagnosis (or selfisolation following contract tracing) up to a certain number of weeks.
If you need to self isolate because you may have COVID19, it is paid for a maximum of 2 weeks.
This can be extended for another 2 weeks, if you are told to selfisolate again following contact tracing by the HSE.
However, you will need to apply for this second period of selfisolation on a separate claim form and have medical certification for this second period of selfisolation.
If you have had 2 successive periods of selfisolation, you must return to work and make a PRSI contribution before you can get enhanced Illness Benefit again.
If you are diagnosed with COVID19, it is paid for a maximum of 10 weeks.
If your medical certificate is for fewer than 10 weeks, you will be paid for the duration of your medical certificate.
You should continue to talk with your doctor about your diagnosis and the length of time you are medically certified unfit to work because of COVID19.
Who cannot get COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit?
You do not get COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit if:
You are cocooning because you are medically vulnerable to COVID19, however, you can apply for standard Illness Benefit which can be paid for longer than COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit or
You are selfisolating because you live with a person who is medically vulnerable to COVID19
Other social welfare payments and COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit
You cannot get COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit and COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the same time.
If your income is a mixture of both earnings from employment and a social welfare payment and you are required to selfisolate or you are diagnosed with COVID19, you continue to get your social welfare payment.
If your social welfare payment is less than the rate of COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit, you can apply for a top up payment from the Illness Benefit section see 'Apply online' below.
You must meet the criteria for COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit to qualify.
This top up payment will not affect any other social welfare payments that you may be getting from the DSP.
Rate of COVID19 enhanced Illness Benefit
The personal rate of enhanced Illness Benefit is €350 per week.
If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, you may get an increase in your payment for your spouse or partner.
You may also get an increase in your payment for dependent children.
Apply online
The DSP needs your application for Illness Benefit and your medical certificate to process your application.
You should apply online for enhanced Illness Benefit.
This is the quickest and easiest way to apply.
All you need to apply online is a basic MyGovID account.
Medical certification
Your doctor can complete a medical certificate on your behalf and send this directly to DSP.
If you have been identified during contact tracing as someone who has been in contact with a person with COVID19, you will get a text or a letter from the HSE with an instruction to you to selfisolate.
You can email an image of this HSE document or text the image along with your name and PPS number to illnessenquiry@welfare.ie.

Data protection and cybersecurity when working from home
Eworking and tax relief
Can I continue to work from home when the COVID19 restrictions have been lifted?
Where to get more information
Ireland is on Level 5 restrictions until 31 January 2021.
Under Level 5, only essential workers should travel to work.
You should work from home unless you are providing an essential service and need to be physically present.
The Living with COVID19 plan sets out how we should live and work.
The Plan sets out 5 levels that correspond to the severity of COVID19 in a location.
Different levels can be in place in different locations in the country.
Employers must ensure the safety, health and welfare at work of all their employees.
Employees also have responsibilities when they are working from home.
Employers' duties
Employers have specific duties to ensure the safety, health and welfare at work of all their employees.
These duties include the employee’s workspace if employees work from home.
Managing and conducting all work activities to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of employees
Providing safe work that is planned, organised, and maintained
Assessing risks and implementing appropriate control measures
Providing safe equipment including personal protective equipment, where necessary
Giving information, instruction, training and supervision about safety and health to employees
Having plans in place for emergencies
If employees have a disability, are young workers or are pregnant, employers need to ensure that the tasks and working conditions do not adversely affect their health.
You can get more information on sensitive risk groups.
Your employer should check with you to ensure:
You are aware of any specific risks when working from home
The work activity and the temporary workspace are suitable
You have suitable equipment to do the work.
For example, your employer should make sure that the applications and systems you need are installed on your computer
There is a prearranged means of contact
Equipment and your workspace at home
If your employer provides equipment, for example, a laptop, mouse, keyboard and headset it must be in good condition and suitable for the activity.
If you already have suitable equipment at home, it can be used temporarily.
Employers must check that your temporary home workspace is suitable for the work.
This includes things like safe access to the space, essential equipment, that the space is big enough and free of clutter, there is adequate lighting, ventilation, heat, and that electrical sockets, plugs and cords are in good condition.
Employers need to communicate regularly with employees and ensure that employees are taking adequate breaks.
Keep in contact with employees
Give regular updates to each employee
Have emergency contacts and procedures in place
Ensure employees take adequate breaks – see our document on rest periods and breaks.
Even though you are working from home you should have the same access to training and promotion opportunities as comparable colleagues working in the office.
Employee responsibilities
If you are working from home, you have a responsibility to take reasonable care of yourself and other people who may be affected by the work you are doing.
Cooperate with your employer and follow their instructions
Protect yourself and others from harm during the course of your work.
For example, you must take care of your equipment and report any problems immediately to your employer
Report injuries to your employer immediately
Follow any procedures put in place by your employer, for example, around checking in regularly
Agree temporary remote working arrangements with your employer, including regular communication with them
Identify the work to be done at home with your employer
Identify the equipment you need to set up a safe workspace at home and agree this with your employer
Identify a suitable safe space within your home for home working
Agree plans and contacts to be used in the event of an emergency
Ensure you have a suitable workspace – See good positioning at your workstation (pdf)
People working from home may feel reluctant to tell their employer that they are unwell.
It is important to note that if you are feeling unwell the normal sick leave rules still apply.
General tips for working from home
We have summarised general tips to help you look after your health and wellbeing while working from home temporarily during the COVID19 pandemic.
Stick to your normal routine as much as possible, starting your day as you normally would: shower, getting dressed and eating breakfast
Keep times for lunch, dinner as close to normal as you can
When taking breaks resist the temptation to just go and make a coffee and come back to your workspace.
Make the effort to go into another room or out to the garden, if you have one
Log off for your lunch break
If your partner is also working from home, arrange to have breaks together in another room or in the garden, if you have one
Give your eyes a break, for 5 to 10 minutes every hour.
Get up, move around and take your eyes off the screen
Try to limit your social and news media intake
Exercise, stretch and go out for a walk if possible
Make sure you rest and get a good night’s sleep
Restrict the amount of alcohol you consume during the week to help you stay focused
Eat healthy foods even though as it is tempting to increase your intake of snack foods
Do take annual leave even if your travel plans have been cancelled, it may help to take even a portion of the leave planned so you can concentrate on your own health and wellbeing
Keep in touch with your colleagues, pick up the phone or video call colleagues that you would usually spend breaks or lunchtime with and chat to them for a few minutes
Annual leave during COVID19 restrictions
You continue to build up your annual leave when you are working from home and working your usual hours.
You may not want to take annual leave during the COVID19 restrictions as your travel options are limited.
However, employers may not want you to keep all your leave until later in the year.
Your employer may ask you to take some of your leave before a certain date.
The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that the timing of an employee’s annual leave can be determined by the employer having regard to work requirements.
Under the Act, an employer can require an employee to take annual leave provided they consult with the employee or their trade union at least one month prior to the taking of annual leave.
Employers need to consider the following when deciding on annual leave:
The need for the employee to reconcile work and family responsibilities, and
The opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee
It should be noted that employees should be left with a proportionate amount of annual leave for the remainder of the year to allow them avail of opportunities for rest and recreation when businesses return back to normal.
Employers are also entitled to refuse annual leave which has already been booked from being cancelled.
Your employer may allow you to carry over annual leave until the next annual leave year.
Data protection and cybersecurity when working from home
The Data Protection Commission has given guidance on protecting personal data when working remotely.
Both employers and employees should ensure that:
Any device used has the necessary updates, such as operating system, software and antivirus updates
Any device is used in a safe location, and that nobody else can view the screen, particularly if working with sensitive personal data
Devices are locked if they are left unattended for any reason and stored carefully when not in use
Effective access controls, such as strong passwords, and, where available, encryption are used to restrict access to the device, and to reduce the risk if a device is stolen or lost
Work email accounts rather than personal ones are used for work related emails involving personal data.
If personal email has to be used, any contents and attachments should be encrypted and personal or confidential data should be avoided in subject lines
Where possible only the organisation’s trusted networks or cloud services are used
Steps are taken to ensure the security and confidentiality of paper records, such as by keeping them locked in a filing cabinet or drawer when not in use and making sure they are not left somewhere where they could be read by others, lost or stolen
The National Cyber Security Centre has published Working From Home Security Advice.
There are certain privacy rules that your employer must follow when monitoring you in the workplace and these rules also apply when you are working from home.
You can get information in our document on surveillance in the workplace.
Eworking and tax relief
If you are working from home, you may be eligible for tax relief on expenses like light, heat, telephone and broadband.
If your employer pays you an allowance towards these expenses, you can get up to €3.20 per day without paying any tax, PRSI or USC on it.
If your employer pays more than €3.20 per day to cover expenses, you pay tax, PRSI and USC as normal on the amount above €3.20.
If your employer does not pay you an allowance for your expenses, you can make a claim for tax relief at the end of the year.
You will get money back from the taxes you paid.
You can read more about Eworking and tax relief.
Should I pay tax on equipment from my employer?
If your employer gives you equipment that you need to do your work, like a computer or printer, and you mainly use it for work, it is not considered a benefit in kind.
This means that you do not have to pay any tax for receiving the equipment from your employer.
Capital Gains Tax
If you use only part of your home for eworking, your home remains your Principal Private Residence and you are not liable for CGT when you sell it.
You can get more information from Revenue.
Can I continue to work from home when the COVID19 restrictions have been lifted?
You do not have a right to work from home.
Your employment rights are primarily set out in your contract of employment.
Some employees may have already written into their contract of employment that they can work from home for a number of hours or days per week.
Those entitlements will remain the same.
Most contracts of employment have a requirement that the employee must appear at a designated place of work.
It is also common for employers to have a right to change the designated place of work.
In those circumstances, employers can insist on you returning to the workplace.
You should talk to your employer first to see if you can continue to work from home.
This will vary between employers.

Where can I make a complaint?
The Government’s Resilience and Recovery 2020 – 2021: Plan for living with COVID19 sets out how we can live and work with COVID19.
The plan sets out 5 levels that correspond to the severity of COVID19 in a location.
Different levels can be in place in different locations in the country.
This document is a summary of the work safely protocol published by the HSA, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
The protocol describes the steps that employers and employees should take before a workplace reopens to make sure they can return to work safely.
It also covers how businesses should operate after they reopen to reduce the spread of COVID19 in the workplace.
The Health Safety Authority (HSA) will carry out workplace inspections and provide guidance for employers.
If their advice is not implemented, the HSA can shut down the workplace.
The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) will also carry out inspections and provide guidance to employers.
Both employers and employees should keep up to date with the latest HSE advice and guidance.
You can get more detailed information in the revised Work Safely Protocol (pdf) (Previously called the Return to Work Safely Protocol).
The revised protocol sets out the minimum measures needed in every workplace to manage and prevent the spread of infection.
It gives information on the selection of hand sanitisers, the wearing of face masks, ventilation of workplaces and symptoms.
There may be additional safeguards in different workplaces.
The protocol may change or be updated over time.
Please check back as we will continue to add information to this document as it is updated.
Planning for return to work
All employers must prepare and put systems and controls in place before they reopen their business and workplaces.
Appoint at least one lead worker representative to make sure safety measures are in place and being followed.
A short online course on the role of lead worker representative can be found on the HSA website.
Update business and safety plans, including the business COVID19 Response Plan, the occupational health and safety risk assessment and the safety statement.
Include how to deal with a suspected case of COVID19 in the safety plans and appoint a dedicated manager in charge of dealing with suspected cases.
Develop, consult on, communicate and implement workplace changes or policies.
Provide COVID19 induction training for all staff.
Put in place temperature testing in line with public health advice.
Put in place any mass COVID19 testing needed in line with public health advice.
Pre return to work form
An employer must send out a prereturn to work form to employees before their return to work.
The employee must submit the form before they return to work.
The form will ask employees to confirm they have not had symptoms of COVID19 in the past 14 days, have not been diagnosed or suspected of COVID19 in the past 14 days, have not been in close contact with someone confirmed or suspected of COVID19 in the past 14 days and are not restricting their movements, selfisolating or cocooning.

COVID19: travel overview
The Travel ‘Green List’
Travel abroad
Travel within Ireland
The Government has eased restrictions on travel within Ireland.
You should avoid nonessential travel abroad, apart from travel to countries on the 'Green List'.
If you are coming to Ireland, this document explains the restrictions and conditions you can expect upon your arrival.
Our document Driving and transport during COVID19 has the latest information on:
License renewals
Driving tests
Vehicle registration
Tax and insurance
If you have made plans to travel within Ireland or abroad and want information on your rights if your trip is cancelled, you can read our document Travel plans and COVID19.
Travelling to Ireland
If you plan to travel to Ireland, you should read the latest travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Passenger Locator Form
If you arrive into Ireland from another country, you must fill in a COVID19 Passenger Locator Form.
This applies to people arriving from a country that is included on the Government’s 'COVID19 green list' and people arriving from a country that is not on the 'COVID19 green list'.
The COVID19 Passenger Locator Form is now an online form.
If you are travelling to Ireland you can complete the form on or before your arrival in Ireland.
The information on the form may be used to contact you to check your location, or to contact you if there is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID19 on your flight or ferry.
If any of the information you provide on the form changes in the next 14 days, you must email passengerlocatorform@plf.ie with updated information.
You may be fined up to €2,500 or imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both if you:
Do not fill in and submit the form to a relevant person
Knowingly provide information that is false or misleading
Do not provide further information when requested
Do not update your residence details if these change within 14 days of your arrival.
You do not have to fill in this form if you are:
Arriving from Northern Ireland
Working in defined essential supply chain roles
A foreign diplomat
A transit passenger who will not be leaving the port or airport
You will only need to fill in part of the form, if you are not staying overnight in the State.
Immigration and employment permits during COVID19
Returning to Ireland and COVID19
Restricting your movement
You should restrict your movements for 14 days after your arrival.
This means you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people and social situations as much as possible.
You do not need to restrict your movements if you are:
Arriving from Northern Ireland
Aircraft crew, including pilots, in Ireland as part of your work
Holder of a Certificate for International Transport Workers, or heavy good vehicle drivers and are in Ireland for work
Ship crew, including the maritime master, in Ireland as part of your work
Arriving from a ‘normal precautions’ listed country (countries on the ‘green list’)
The Travel ‘Green List’
On 21 July 2020, the Government published a ‘green list’ of countries with a similar or lower incidence of COVID19 to that of Ireland.
People entering Ireland from these locations do not have to restrict their movements for 14 days.
The list is intended to act as a guide to where Irish residents may travel safely for essential purposes, such as for essential work or to care for family members.
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFA) travel advice for countries on the ‘green list’ is that you should take ‘normal precautions’.
This means that the country is as safe as Ireland.
The security rating for all other locations remains unchanged at either ‘avoid nonessential travel’ (‘orange’) or to ‘do not travel’ (‘red’).
If you are arriving in Ireland from a country on the Government green list, you should follow public health advice while you are in Ireland.
This means you should:
Keep 2 metres distance from people
Avoid crowded places
Wear a face covering if you are on public transport and when you are in a shop or other indoor space where it is difficult to keep 2 metres distance from other people
Work from home where possible
Wear a face covering when visiting someone who is over 70 or is medically vulnerable to COVID19
If you have symptoms of COVID19, you should selfisolate and contact a GP by telephone.
The green list from 21 September 2020
An update to the green list was published on 17 September 2020 and comes into force on 21 September 2020.
After this, the list will be updated every week until a new EUwide system is agreed.
Ireland will support the European Commission’s proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU/EEA.
The European Commission’s proposal is still being finalised, but is expected to be approved in October 2020.
What happens if the country I am visiting is removed from the Government ‘green list’ while I’m there?
If you travel to a country or territory on the ‘green list’ and the country is removed from the list while you are abroad, you will have to restrict your movements for 14 days to minimise your risk of spreading the virus.
Travel abroad
The Irish Government is currently advising against all nonessential travel abroad, apart from countries included on the Government's 'COVID19 green list' where the advice is to take 'normal precautions'.
If you have booked a trip abroad and want information on your consumer rights, you can read our document Travel plans and COVID19.
Traveling abroad may affect your social welfare payment.
You should also check with your employer whether you will continue to be paid if you have to restrict your movements on upon your return.
Passports
The Passport Service has resumed the processing of online applications for all passport types.
You should expect delays to your application.
The processing of Passport Express applications has also recommenced in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The turnaround time for processing paper based applications is 68 weeks.
Passport phone lines are now open.
If you urgently need a passport to travel (because of the death or serious illness of a family member, or you need urgent medical treatment abroad), you should contact the Passport Service through webchat.
Travel within Ireland
If you live in Dublin you should not travel to other parts of the country while Dublin is at level 3 of the 'Plan for Living with COVID19', unless you have to travel for work, education or essential purposes.
If you live outside of Dublin, you should avoid travelling to Dublin while it is level 3, unless you have to travel there for work, education or essential purposes.
To encourage people to holiday at home, the Government has introduced a new ‘Stay and Spend Tax Credit’.
The scheme allows you to claim a certain amount of tax back on accommodation, food and nonalcoholic drink purchased between 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021.
This scheme has now opened.

Family law during COVID19
COVID19 has had a big impact on the lives of families across Ireland.
The Government has introduced measures to control the spread of COVID19.
You should continue to follow advice on how you can protect yourself and others, including advice on social distancing.
This document gives practical information and advice on family law issues during the COVID19 emergency period, including:
Access to children
Maintenance payments
Barring, safety and protection orders
Operation of courts during COVID19
Services and supports available to people at risk of domestic abuse
You can also read about:
Supports for children and parents during COVID19
Childcare and COVID19
Getting married
Access to children
The Law Society of Ireland has published updated guidance on dealing with access issues (pdf) that arise during to COVID19.
The guidance is clear that public health restrictions could not be used as an excuse to ignore a court order and that existing orders should be complied with as much as possible in the circumstances.
However, parents should always make decisions in the best interests of the child involved, particularly if the child has a compromised immune system.
The best outcome for children is for parents to contact each other to set out their concerns and suggest ideas for practical solutions that can be put in place.
Any changes to existing court orders should be documented in a text or email so that there is a written record for future reference.
Family mediation
If matters can still not be agreed, the parties should try mediation.
Mediation is not relationship counselling.
Family mediation is a free service which helps separating couples and parents whose relationship has broken down to negotiate their own agreement.
With mediation you will be helped to make your own decisions that suit your circumstances.
If you decide to go to court it will be a judge who will ultimately make these decisions.
The Family Mediation Service is a service provided by the Legal Aid Board.
It provides facetoface mediation and online mediation through its national network of family law mediation service offices.
Details of how to make an appointment and the contact details of each office are available at legalaidboard.ie.
Family mediation is also available privately.
A mediator may charge in a variety of ways, such as an hourly rate, day rate or flat rate.
Contact details of family law mediation solicitors are available on lawsociety.ie and the Mediator's Institute of Ireland website mii.ie.
Placement of children with relatives and temporary guardianship
You may be concerned about who will look after your children if you become sick.
This might be of particular concern if you are parenting alone.
In many cases, other family members will be able to help.
If there is no obvious standin or where there is an important decision to be made in relation to the child, such as consent to medical treatment, it may be reassuring to have a plan in place.
On 12 May 2020, temporary regulations (pdf) took effect to make it easier and quicker for a child to be placed with a relative by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.
Tusla must be satisfied that the immediate placement of a child in its care with a relative of the child is in the interests of the child.
These regulations have been amended to apply for a period of 12 months.
Temporary guardianship can be granted by the District Court to allow another adult, known as the nominated person, to care for your child or children when you are seriously unwell or need be hospitalised.
You need to complete a special form to nominate a temporary guardian (pdf), in which you can set out your wishes or any limitations on the temporary guardian.
The nominated person must then apply to the court if you cannot carry out your parental role due to serious illness.
The scope of temporary guardian’s rights will be set out in the District Court’s Order, which will usually be identical to the wishes you set out in the form.
The District Court is currently closed for general case hearings but if your case is urgent it will be heard.
Support organisations for families
One Family, the national support organisation for lone parents, has published a practical guide on managing access during COVID19.
Treoir, the National Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, provides information and advice on 01 670 0120, 10am – 4pm, Monday to Friday.
Barnardos has a dedicated telephone and email service to support families through the pandemic.
You can read more supports for children and parents during COVID19.
Maintenance
Parents who pay child maintenance should continue making payments as normal during COVID19.
The Legal Aid Board has published advice on dealing with maintenance issues if you have had a change in employment status or you have reduced income.
You are advised to:
Tell the person who gets the maintenance that you will not be able to pay the agreed amount of maintenance and explain why.
This should be done before the payment is due, if possible.
You should also send a letter to their solicitor (if they have one) explaining your position and include any available evidence that shows a change in your financial circumstances.
You should consult your solicitor for advice, if possible, about an appropriate payment to make in the changed circumstances.
You should tell your expartner (or the parent of your child) as soon as possible how much you intend to pay and try to reach an agreement with them.
If agreement cannot be reached, you should pay what you are advised or believe is the appropriate amount in the circumstances and apply for an order to vary the maintenance as soon as possible.
Applications to vary maintenance should be lodged as soon as possible, for whatever return date is given, so that applications can be made to backdate orders.
Where the person receiving the maintenance is in difficulty, their circumstances should also be considered.
If there are any issues with making mortgage payments and other joint bills, you should communicate (through your solicitor or directly) with your former partner or parent of your child.
Both parties should work together to notify banks or other third parties that there is an issue with payment of bills.
FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) has published advice for people having difficulty paying maintenance during COVID19.
You can call FLAC’s Information line on 1890 350 250 or 01 874 5690, 9.30am – 1pm, Monday to Friday, and 7pm – 9pm on Monday evenings.
OneParent Family Payment and Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment
If you are getting a OneParent Family Payment or Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment and the other parent of your child has reduced or stopped their maintenance payment, you may be entitled to an increase in your payment.
To get an increase, you should contact your local Intreo Centre.
You will need to write a letter stating either the reduced amount, or that you are no longer getting a maintenance payment and provide it to your local Intreo Centre.
Your OneParent Family Payment or Jobseeeker's Transition Payment will be increased for a period of up to 12 weeks.
After that, your payment may be reviewed and your means reassessed.
Law courts
To find out the most up to date information on how the courts are operating or to make an appointment, you can contact the relevant office.
Guidance has been issued on attending court safely and what measures you should take to ensure your safety and the safety of others.
The District Court will continue to deal with some family law and child care cases for the duration of the Level 5 restrictions.
The Circuit and High Courts also continue to deal with urgent cases, particularly those involving allegations of domestic abuse and to process:
New applications for protection orders
New applications for interim barring orders
Applications for emergency barring orders
Extension of care orders and interim care orders and emergency care orders and exceptional or urgent interim care orders
If you cannot afford to ask the court for protection from an abusive spouse or partner or another family member, you can apply for legal aid.
Contact the Legal Aid Board on 1890 615 200, 10am – 12.30pm and 2pm – 4pm, Monday to Friday.
Alternatively you can email your contact details to info@legalaidboard.ie and arrange a callback, or you can make an application for legal aid online.
You can also contact the Legal Aid Board if Tusla has informed you that it intends to apply to the court to take your children into care.
Domestic abuse
Domestic abuse is violence or another form of abuse by a person against another person that they are, or were, in an intimate relationship with.
The abuse may be physical, sexual, psychological, emotional or financial.
Domestic abuse can affect children and other family members.
Rent Supplement and domestic violence
Victims of domestic violence referred from Tuslafunded services, An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive (HSE) can get immediate access to Rent Supplement.
The meanstest for Rent Supplement will not apply for 3 months.
Child protection
If a child protection issue emerges during the current health crisis and you have reasonable grounds for concern that a child may have been, is being, or is at risk of being abused or neglected, you should contact Tusla or the Gardaí.
You can report your concern to Tusla in person, by telephone or in writing to the local social work service in the area where the child lives.
Support
Many organisations have extended and adapted their services during COVID19 due to increased demand for support.
You can access a list of domestic abuse support services available or find out what support services are available in each county in Ireland on stillhere.ie.
The ISPCC has a support line and hub for parents and carers as well as its 24hour Childline and Teenline listening services for children and young people up to the age of 18:

Your doctor will assess you over the phone.
If they think you need to be tested for COVID19, they will arrange a test.
Selfisolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people, including people you live with.
If you live with others, they also need to restrict their movements.
Getting around
As part of Phase 3 of the Government roadmap, you can travel anywhere in the country from 29 June 2020.
Public transport
Public transport services are running but you should only use public transport for essential journeys.
If you have to use public transport, wearing a face covering is mandatory.
Read about using public transport during COVID19.
Driving
The COVID19 pandemic has caused disruption to driving licencing, testing and National Car Test services in Ireland.
You can find out more about this in our document on Driving and Transport during COVID19.

Learner permits that are due to expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 October 2020 are automatically renewed for 4 months.
If you have a valid full foreign driving licence, you can drive on this for up to 12 months while visiting Ireland.
If you plan to stay in Ireland for longer than 12 months, you should apply to convert your foreign driving licence for an Irish licence if you are eligible, or go through the driving test process to get an Irish driving licence.
Importing a vehicle
All vehicles brought into Ireland are subject to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and must be registered.
Vehicle registration inspections are currently suspended due to the public health emergency.
For more information on importing a vehicle to Ireland, including details of VRT exemptions and when VRT testing will resume, read our document on Importing a car into Ireland.

Groups at increased risk from COVID19 (coronavirus) and what they should do
Pregnancy and coronavirus
If you develop symptoms on your return to Ireland, you need to selfisolate and phone any local GP.

Income supports
Depending on your circumstances, you may need financial assistance when you return to Ireland.
The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) has a range of social welfare payments to provide financial support.
The quickest way to apply for these is online through MyWelfare.
To do this you will need to create a MyGovID account.
You will also need a Personal Public Service (PPS) number.
PPS numbers
You must have a Personal Public Service (PPS) number to apply for a social welfare payment.
If you have worked in Ireland before you may already have a PPS number.

You must download and fill out the REG1 form and send it to with a scanned image or photograph of your identity document (passport, driving licence, ID card) and proof of address (utility bill, letter from landlord to PPSN@welfare.ie.
Applying for social welfare
The Returning to Ireland section of our website gives information on how to access social welfare as a returning Irish emigrant.
If you are applying for a social assistance payment, you need to show that Ireland is currently your main place of residence.
This is called the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC).
You do not have to have been living in Ireland for a certain period of time to be considered habitually resident.
You can read more about returning Irish emigrants and the HRC.
Crosscare Migrant Project’s website also has useful FAQs on the HRC and you can also contact them for support if you are having difficulty with your application
People who have lost employment outside Ireland are not eligible for the new COVID19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment upon returning to Ireland because the payment is only for people who have lost employment in Ireland.
They may access other social welfare payments such as Jobseeker’s Allowance and Basic Supplementary Allowance.

Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme
Rules for EWSS
Rates
How to apply
Under the July Jobs Stimulus Package the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) from 1 September 2020.
It will run until 31 March 2021.
Under the EWSS scheme, employers and new firms in sectors impacted by COVID19 whose turnover has fallen 30% will get a flatrate subsidy per week based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll, including seasonal staff and new employees.
If an employee has more than one job, each employer can make a claim under the EWSS, ignoring any other employments the employee may have.
The TWSS finished on 31 August 2020 and no new applications can be accepted from that date.
The two schemes ran in parallel from 1 July until the TWSS closed on 31 August 2020.
This page is a summary of the EWSS rules and operation.
You can get more detailed guidance on the operation of the scheme from Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines (pdf).
Rules for EWSS
How do I qualify?
To qualify for the scheme you must:
Have valid tax clearance
Meet the reduction in turnover or customer orders test
Tax clearance
In order to receive the EWSS payments, you must:
Have a valid tax clearance certificate
Continue to maintain tax clearance for the duration of the scheme
You can check your current tax clearance status online through ROS.
More information on tax clearance is available from Revenue.
The July Stimulus Package included measures on ‘warehousing’ or deferral of unpaid VAT and Employers PAYE debt associated with COVID19.
You can get more information on the initiatives covering COVID19 related tax debts in Revenue’s Information Booklet (pdf).
Reduction in turnover or customer orders test
You must selfdeclare to Revenue that you have experienced significant negative economic disruption due to COVID19, with a minimum of 30% decline in turnover or customer orders (between July and December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019).
The review of turnover or orders should look at the period as whole, not individual months.
For new businesses, this is based on a projected forward test.
If you are a registered childcare provider, you do not need to meet the 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders test.
If you have a more complex business structure and need help determining your eligibility for the scheme, you can get further guidance in Appendix I of Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines.
Eligible employees
The scheme is available for employers who keep staff on their payroll during the pandemic.
Temporarily not working or
On reduced hours or reduced pay (or both)
An eligible employer must be paying gross wages between €151.50 and €1,462 gross per week to qualify for EWSS (see Rates below).
If you have a new employee (new hire or a seasonal worker), they can start the EWSS from 1 July 2020.
You can get more information on how to make applications for new hires and seasonal workers in Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines (pdf).
Certain categories of employees are excluded from the EWSS.
Proprietary directors (with the exception of those who keep ‘ordinary’ employees on the payroll – see below)
Connected parties who were not on the payroll and paid at any time between July 2019 and June 2020
Proprietary directors who keep ‘ordinary’ employees on the payroll are being reinstated to the EWSS from 1 September.
Revenue will provide more guidance shortly and this document will be updated when more information becomes available.
You can read additional guidance on eligible employees and excluded categories in Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines.
Applications for EWSS are based on selfassessment principles.
This means you will not have to provide proof of eligibility to Revenue at the registration stage.
Revenue will review eligibility in the future, based on risk criteria see ‘Compliance checks’ below.
You should keep proof of your eligibility for the scheme (evidence of reduction in turnover and other evidence).
You can read detailed information on the supporting proofs in Appendix I of Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines.
Eligibility review
On the last day of every month, you must complete a review to make sure you continue to meet the scheme’s eligibility criteria (looking at the period as a whole rather than on a monthly basis).
If you no longer qualify, you must:
Deregister for EWSS through ROS with effect from the 1st day of the next month
Stop claiming the subsidy
The requirement to do an eligibility review does not apply for July 2020 and the final month of the scheme.
You can get more information on eligibility reviews in Revenue’s EWSS Guidance (pdf).
Compliance checks
Revenue will be contacting employers in the future to check records relating to the operation of the scheme including:
Evidence that you meet the eligibility criteria, specifically the reduction in turnover or customer orders test
Details of monthly eligibility reviews
More information on compliance checks will be made available by Revenue.
Rates
The subsidy amount paid to employers will depend on the gross income of each employee.
EWSS will give a flatrate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.
For every employee paid between €203 and €1,462 gross per week, the subsidy is €203.
For every employee paid between €151.50 and €202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is €151.50.
No subsidy is paid for employees paid less than €151.50 or more than €1,462 gross per week.
Income tax and PRSI deductions
Under the EWSS employers will have to resume the normal requirement to operate PAYE on all payments.
This means you should resume the regular deduction of income tax, USC and employee PRSI from your employees’ pay.
If an employment is eligible for the subsidy, a 0.5% rate of employer’s PRSI will apply.
Backdating of subsidy
The subsidy can be backdated to 1 July in some cases.
New hires or seasonal workers
Employees who were not eligible for TWSS (excluding employees who were not eligible for any subsidy when their income was tapered under the rules for TWSS)
New employers to the EWSS who were not claiming TWSS or were not eligible for TWSS
The payment will be made after 14 September.
You can get more information on backdated payments in Revenue’s EWSS guidance (pdf).
How to apply
From 18 August, you, your agent or payroll provider will be able to register for the EWSS through Revenue’s Online Service (ROS).
Applications will only be processed if you:
Are registered for Employer’s PAYE/PRSI (PREM)
Have a bank account linked to the PREM registration
Have tax clearance
Registration will be through the eRegistration system.
You will have to make a selfdeclaration as part of this process.
You can get detailed instructions on the process you should follow to operate Revenue’s EWSS on your payroll in Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines.
You can get more help from Revenue’s National Employer Helpdesk through the myEnquiries system or by calling the National Employer helpline Tel: 01 738 3638 (Monday to Friday, from 9.00am to 5.00pm).
If you have a question about your situation during the COVID19 emergency period, you can request a call back from the Citizens Information Service.

How is the Government responding to Coronavirus (COVID19)?
The Government has introduced measures to protect the public by delaying the spread of the virus.
Keep this leaflet in a safe place, follow the guidance and keep up to date with advice at www.hse.ie
What is Coronavirus (COVID19)?
COVID19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.
It’s caused by a virus called Coronavirus.
Coronavirus (COVID19) is spread in sneeze or cough droplets.
Current evidence suggests that the virus can spread as easily as the flu virus that circulates every winter.
Viruses can be easily spread to other people and you are normally infectious until all your symptoms have gone.
Coronavirus (COVID19) may survive on surfaces if someone who has it coughs or sneezes onto it.
Simple household disinfectants can kill the virus on surfaces.
The evidence so far suggests that:
80% of cases Patients experience mild illness and make a full recovery within a few weeks
14% of cases Patients experience more severe illness
6% of cases Patients experience critical illness
Coronavirus
COVID19 Public Information
What are the symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID19)?
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.
The most common symptoms are:
Cough
This can be any kind of cough, usually dry but not always
Fever
High temperature over 38 degrees Celsius
Shortness of Breath
Breathing Difficulties
You may display one, some or all of these symptoms.
If you are experiencing worrying symptoms, you should contact your GP OR call HSELive 1850 24 1850.
Coronavirus
COVID19 Information
How can I protect myself from getting Coronavirus (COVID19)?
Wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face with your hands.
Hand gels with at least 60% alcohol content can be used if soap and water are not available.
How to wash your hands with soap and water
Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap.
Rub your hands together until the soap forms a lather.
Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Do this for about 20 seconds.
Rinse your hands under running water.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.
A video demonstration is available at hse.ie/handhygiene
When coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue.
Put used tissues into a closed bin and wash your hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Use regular household disinfectants to clean surfaces.
Do not shake hands or make close contact where possible.
We recommend social distancing for all people to decrease the spread of the virus.
Social distance measures work by reducing contact between sick and healthy individuals.
We also recommend that you reduce social interactions to help protect yourself from getting the virus.
Reduce the number of people you meet day to day.
Some of the things you can do include:
Reduce interactions with people outside the workplace and the home
Increase your distance from others – keep separate by at least 1 metre (3ft), ideally at least 2 metres (6ft)
Don’t shake hands
Ideally avoid communal sleeping areas
Avoid crowded places
Work from home if possible
When in crowded settings like public transport or a supermarket, practise personal protective measures by:
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth AND
Cleaning your hands often
Coronavirus
COVID19 Information
Who are atrisk groups?
There are some groups of people who may be more at risk of serious illness if they catch Coronavirus (COVID19).
These groups include:
People over 75 are particularly vulnerable
All people aged 60 years and over
People (adults and children) with longterm medical conditions including people with cardiac and respiratory conditions
People whose immune system is impaired due to disease or treatment including cancer patients
Patients with any condition that can affect respiratory function (breathing)
Residents of nursing homes and other longstay settings including disability, mental health and older persons services
All over 50year olds within the specialist disability health services
All people in the specialist disability health services with an underlying health problem
Further support for older people
The charity ALONE, in partnership with the Department of Health and HSE, has a Coronavirus (COVID19) support line for older people.
Older people can contact ALONE on 0818 222 024.
What should I do if I’m feeling unwell?
If you are experiencing flulike symptoms like fever and/or cough, you should immediately selfisolate regardless of travel or contact history.
We explain how to selfisolate on page 11.
If you are experiencing these symptoms and are concerned you have been in contact with a person infected with Coronavirus (COVID19), selfisolate and contact your GP (family doctor) by phone.
Do not go to your GP surgery in person.
Your GP will assess you and decide if a test for Coronavirus (COVID19) is necessary.
You can also call HSELive on 1850 24 1850 for further guidance.
How should I limit social interaction?
Limited social interaction is avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible.
You may need to do this if you are a close contact of a confirmed case of Coronavirus (COVID19).
This is to stop other people from getting the virus if you develop symptoms.
If you are told to limit social interaction, you should:
Reduce interactions with people outside the workplace and the home
Increase your distance from others – keep separate by at least 1 metre (3ft), ideally at least 2 metres (6ft)
Don’t shake hands
Ideally avoid communal sleeping areas
Avoid crowded places
Work from home if possible
You can still go outside for walks, runs or cycles on your own.
However, you should avoid spending more than 15 minutes in close contact with other people.
What will I need if I’m told to stay at home?
To help stop the spread of Coronavirus (COVID19) you may be asked to either:
Limit social interactions with other people
Selfisolate
Here are some practical steps you can take now which will be useful if you become unwell:
Alert close family, friends and neighbours over the phone and tell them that you are not feeling well and are unable to receive visitors
Organise in advance to get someone to do shopping for you.
If you are getting something delivered to your home, make sure it is left outside the front door for you to get it rather than bringing people into your home
Make an uptodate list of your medicines.
If you become unwell, this is important information especially if you need treatment from a different doctor than usual
There is no need to order extra medicines over and above normal requirements.
Doing so will reduce supply of medicines for others.
The supply of medicines will continue
If you have symptoms, please do not attend your pharmacy in person.
You can phone your pharmacist if you need to order a prescription.
If you need to collect prescription or nonprescription medicines, ask a family member or friend to do so.
How should I selfisolate?
Selfisolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people.
You may need to do this if you have symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID19).
This is to stop other people from getting it.
If you have symptoms then you MUST selfisolate and contact your GP by phone.
If they think you need to get tested for the virus, they will organise this.
While you wait for the test results or if you test positive but have mild symptoms, you can selfisolate at home.
Selfisolating Guidelines
The following guidelines 1–10 should be followed by people who have to selfisolate due to Coronavirus (COVID19).
Stay at home
Do not go to work, college, school, religious services, social gatherings or public areas.
Do not use public transport or taxis until you are well.
2 Keep away from other people in your home as much as you can
Avoid physical contact with other people in your household.
Stay in a room with the window open.
If possible, you should use a separate toilet and bathroom to the rest of the household.
If this is not possible, make sure these areas are kept clean.
Wash your hands often
Keep your hands clean by washing them regularly with soap and water.
This is one of the most important things you can do.
Cover your coughs and sneezes
When coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue.
Put used tissues into a closed bin and wash your hands.
Avoid sharing things
You should avoid sharing dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding or other items with other people in your home.
After you use these items, they should be washed in a dishwasher or alternatively with soap and hot water.
Don’t share games consoles or remote controls.
Self isolating Guidelines Continued
Monitor your symptoms
If your symptoms develop or get worse, phone your GP.
If it is an emergency, call an ambulance on 112 or 999 and tell them that you may have Coronavirus (COVID19).
Avoid having visitors in your home
If possible, do not allow visitors into your home or answer your door to callers.
Household cleaning
Many cleaning and disinfectant products sold in supermarkets can kill Coronavirus (COVID19) on surfaces.
Clean the surface as usual with a detergent, disinfectant or disinfectant wipe.
Wear disposable gloves and a plastic apron if available and throw them out afterwards.
Wash your hands after removing gloves and apron.
Laundry
Wear gloves while handling dirty laundry and wash with detergent at a temperature above 60 degrees Celsius or at the highest temperature suitable for the fabric (whichever is higher).
Rubbish
Use plastic bags for collecting rubbish including used tissues, gloves, masks and aprons.
Dispose of rubbish bags when threequarters full by tying the bag.
Place the first bag in a second bag, which you should then also tie.
Keeping well during selfisolation
Infectious disease outbreaks, like the current Coronavirus (COVID19), can be worrying and can affect your mental health.
While you may be anxious, there are many things you can do to support and manage your mental health during such times.
Keep yourself mobile by getting up and moving around as much as possible.
If you have a garden or backyard go out and get some fresh air, but keep more than 2 metres away from other people.
Selfisolation can be boring or frustrating.
It may affect your mood and feelings.
You may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping.
You may find it helps to stay in touch with friends or relatives by phone or on social media.

﻿Your COVID19 vaccine
If you’ve got questions about your vaccine, there are answers you can trust at www.hse.ie
The HSE is rolling out COVID19 vaccines across Ireland, bringing hope to our communities and offering us protection from COVID19.
We’re already seeing reduced illness and fewer deaths among groups who are vaccinated.
Getting your vaccine protects you, once you allow time for your vaccine to work.
When groups of people are vaccinated, this can protect the people around you too.
This booklet tells you what you need to know about getting your COVID19 vaccine.
how COVID19 spreads and its symptoms
how to register for your vaccine
about how your vaccine protects you
about developing and approving vaccines
what to expect at a HSE vaccination centre
how long your vaccine takes to work and what you can do after it
Over the coming weeks and months, everyone in Ireland who is eligible will be able to receive a free COVID19 vaccine from the HSE.
This should offer us more options for safely returning to our health and social care services, to our education, spending time with loved ones, and reopening our society.
Because the more people who are protected from COVID19, the better things will be for us all.
How COVID19 spreads and its symptoms
COVID19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, and sometimes other parts of your body.
It’s caused by a virus called SARSCoV2, a type of coronavirus.
It’s highly infectious.
The most common way you can get COVID19 is by coming into close contact with someone who has the virus.
You can spread the virus even if you do not have symptoms.
It’s mainly spread through close contact and droplets that come from your nose and mouth.
For example, from someone who is talking loudly, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing.
This happens when people are within 1 to 2 metres of each other.
COVID19 can also spread easily in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.
You can get the virus from infected surfaces too.
Because I have a health condition, getting the vaccine meant the world to me after a stressful and sometimes scary year of living through a pandemic.
This past year has been tough.
I was lucky to be able to work from home.
But I still spent the year worrying about myself, my family and my friends.
I have never felt so excited to visit my GP as I did when I went to receive my first dose.
It felt like a light at the end of a very long tunnel.
Common symptoms
a fever (high temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
a new cough this can be any kind of cough, not just dry
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss or change to your sense of smell or taste
COVID19 can cause anyone, at any age, serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.
Pregnant women, people with certain health conditions and older people have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get COVID19.
If you have any symptoms of COVID19, selfisolate (stay in your room) and phone a GP (doctor).
Your GP can arrange a COVID19 test for you.
Your test and GP assessment are free of charge.
For factual, expert information you can trust on COVID19, please visit www.hse.ie/coronavirus or call HSELive on 1850 24 1850.
How COVID19 vaccines protect you
COVID19 vaccines offer you protection from COVID19.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect you from diseases.
All vaccines do this, but different types of vaccine work in different ways.
The surface of the virus that causes COVID19 is studded with spikes.
These spikes allow the virus to attach to the cells of your body.
They’re important in how the vaccines can help protect you.
When you get your vaccine, it triggers an immune response that tells your body to make antibodies.
While your vaccine doesn’t stay in your body for very long, the antibodies stay and stop virus spikes from attaching to your cells.
After your body has time to produce these antibodies, you’re less likely to get sick with COVID19.
You’re much less likely to get seriously ill or need to go to hospital.
It’s much safer to get immunity through your vaccination, than by getting COVID19.
While it’s up to you to decide to get the vaccine, the HSE, the World Health Organization and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you do so, as soon as it’s offered to you.
Number of doses
For most COVID19 vaccines, people need 2 doses, at separate times, to get longer lasting protection.
There are also vaccines that are given in 1 dose.
If you had COVID19 in the last 6 months, you only need 1 dose of a vaccine.
Breastfeeding and pregnancy
You can get the COVID19 vaccine if you’re breastfeeding.
If you’re pregnant, talk to your obstetrician or GP about getting your COVID19 vaccine.
More information is available at www.hse.ie/covidvacpreg
If you already had COVID19
Your vaccine reduces your risk of getting COVID19 again.
It can reduce the seriousness of your symptoms if you do.
Your vaccine cannot give you COVID19
If you get COVID19 soon after your vaccination, it’s possible you caught it before your appointment.
Registering when it’s your turn
Look out for when you can register
The HSE will let you know when it’s your turn to register through www.hse.ie, news or public advertising.
Most people need to register online at www.hse.ie to get their free COVID19 vaccine at a HSE vaccination centre.
Some people are vaccinated elsewhere, like at their GP or local pharmacy.
Please do not register until it’s your turn.
Check what you need to register online
To register online, you need:
a mobile phone number
an email address
your Personal Public Service (PPS) number
your Eircode
Text message is the main way the HSE communicates with you about your vaccination.
If you do not have all of these, you can still register.
Call the COVID19 helpline on 1850 24 1850 to register by phone instead.
You can use a smartphone, tablet or computer to register online.
If you do not have one of these, call the helpline to register.
Register online
When it’s your turn, visit vaccine.hse.ie to register.
Click ‘Start now’ and choose your group
at busy times, there may be a queue.
Create your account you will receive a verification email.
Click on the link in the verification email you then get a verification text (SMS).

Wait for your appointment text
You do not get your appointment immediately.
It could be a few weeks after you register.
You will get a text 3 to 7 days before your appointment.
This tells you the date, time, HSE vaccination centre to go to and which vaccine you’re getting.
If you need to, you can request a new appointment by following the instructions in your appointment text.
The HSE may send you text messages with any other updates you need to know.
Development and approval of vaccines
The HSE only uses COVID19 vaccines that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved.
While COVID19 vaccine development moved fast, the vaccines have gone through the same steps as all licensed medicines.
This included:
pharmaceutical quality checks
nonclinical trials
three phases of clinical trials with tens of thousands of people The EMA then scientifically evaluated and authorised the COVID19 vaccines for use in Europe.
More information on how COVID19 vaccines are approved is available at www.ema.europa.eu
Speed of development
There are a few reasons why vaccines were developed quickly.
There was huge global investment into researching and developing the vaccines.
A lot of people had COVID19 when they were developed, so scientists could learn quickly that they’re effective.
Manufacturers started to make the vaccines, so they were ready to go if approved.
Effectiveness
Worldwide, vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year, and protect many more from lifelong illnesses.
Millions of people have received COVID19 vaccines all over the world.
There’s strong, reliable evidence that COVID19 vaccines greatly reduce your risk of getting COVID19.
They’re highly effective at preventing deaths and serious illness from COVID19.
In Ireland alone, we’re already seeing reduced illness and fewer deaths among people who are vaccinated.
Monitoring
In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) regulates medicines.
It monitors the safety and effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines after they’re approved for use.
You can find out more at www.hpra.ie
Side effects
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.
Most of these are mild to moderate, shortterm, and not everyone gets them.
When you’re getting vaccinated, the HSE gives you a detailed leaflet with information about possible side effects of your vaccine.
The vaccines are new and information about longterm side effects is limited.
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) at www.hpra.ie/report As more people get vaccinated, more information becomes available.
The HSE regularly updates both www.hse.ie and its vaccine information leaflets.
At the HSE vaccination centre
Arrive at the HSE vaccination centre
Appointments take about 30 minutes and are well spaced out at these large venues.
Your appointment is at your nearest available HSE vaccination centre.
When you arrive, follow the signs or instructions from the stewards.
Information about parking and site facilities is available at www.hse.ie/covidvaccinationcentres
Checkin at reception
The receptionist takes your details and confirms your ID.
If you registered without a PPS number, you need proof of address.
You get a HSE vaccine information leaflet and the manufacturer’s leaflet.
Remember, vaccination is by appointment only.
Check what ID and proof of address you need at www.hse.ie
My vaccination day checklist
If I have COVID19 symptoms, selfisolate, phone my GP and request a new appointment.
Bring appointment information, face covering, ID and, if needed, proof of address.
Go alone, if possible, and arrive on time.
Ask a family member or friend to help me get there or get around, if needed.
Wear a shortsleeved tshirt or sleeves I can roll up.
Move to a vaccination booth
A trained vaccinator can answer any questions you have.
They check that you’re okay to get your vaccine and confirm your consent to be vaccinated.
The vaccinator gives you the COVID19 vaccine as an injection in your upper arm.
It only takes a few minutes.
You then receive an aftercare advice leaflet.
They also give you a vaccine record card with the name and batch number of your vaccine.
Go to the observation area before you leave
Stay here for at least 15 minutes.
There’s someone here to make sure you’re feeling well.
Unless you’re asked to stay longer, you can then leave the HSE vaccination centre.
After your vaccine, it’s okay to drive as long as you’re feeling okay.
If you need a second dose, you get a text message with another appointment.
The time between your appointments can vary.
Thank you for protecting yourself and others.
When you’re vaccine protected
Getting your COVID19 vaccine reduces your risk of getting COVID19 and protects you from serious complications of the illness.
In the future, you’ll also have access to a digital vaccination certificate that proves you have received your vaccine in Ireland, should you need it.
When you have allowed time for your vaccine to work, some activities with other people are much safer than before you had vaccine protection.
This is sometimes known as your vaccine bonus or vaccine dividend.
Meeting others after your vaccine
Once your vaccine has had time to work, you’re considered vaccine protected.
You can meet indoors with:
vaccine protected people from up to 2 other households
people who are not vaccinated from 1 other household as long as no one from that household is at high risk from COVID19
You can do this without wearing face coverings or staying 2 metres apart.
Residents of longterm care facilities
If at least 8 out of 10 residents are vaccine protected, you can have:
up to 4 visits per week with up to 2 people per visit
If you and your visitor are both vaccine protected, you do not need to wear face coverings or stay 2 metres apart when you’re alone together in a room or car.
Close contacts
If you’re a vaccine protected close contact of a person who tests positive for COVID19, you do not need to:
restrict your movements (stay at home) for 14 days
be tested for COVID19
If you’re immunocompromised, the contact tracing team will advise you what you need to do.
Your vaccine takes time to work
After your vaccine, wait until it has time to work before following the vaccine bonus advice.
Pfizer / BioNTech 7 days after 2nd dose
Moderna 14 days after 2nd dose
AstraZeneca 28 days after 1st dose you still need to get your 2nd dose
Janssen 14 days after single dose
If you had COVID19 in the last 6 months, confirmed with a laboratory test, you can also follow the vaccine bonus advice unless you’re aged 65 or older or you’re immunocompromised.
Keep protecting yourself and others after your vaccine
As you begin to socialise more and meet up with people who you have not seen for a long time, you should still be careful.
Remember, lots of people have not yet been vaccinated.
This means that you still need to keep 2 metres from others, wear a face covering and wash your hands regularly.
You should also avoid crowds, poorly ventilated spaces and meeting people who are restricting their movements or selfisolating.
This helps to protect you and everyone else, even when you’re vaccine protected.
As more and more people are vaccinated, pay attention to the public health advice that’s relevant to you.
Find factual, expert advice you can trust at www.hse.ie
It’s hard to describe how uplifting the days we’re vaccinating are, both for those coming in and for all of our team.
Many of our older patients, and those with chronic medical conditions, have had to give up so much.
Many have had no face to face contact with friends or family, or have not even felt safe going to the local shop for milk.
We’re so proud to help them get back to enjoying their life to the full.
Now that almost all of our over 70s are vaccine protected, it’s lovely to hear them making plans catching up with their friends, getting their hair done or simply hugging their grandchildren.
Most people are aware of the dangers posed by COVID19 and the overwhelming scientific evidence in favour of vaccination.
There have been some questions about side effects.
But in the end, having listened to all of the evidence, most decided to proceed.
At the end of the day, it’s a personal choice.
Your GP or another health professional caring for you can answer any questions you have, so that you’re ready when it’s offered to you.
Keep well
This is still a hard time for us all, and there are things that you can do to help yourself feel healthy and well.
Keep active and go outdoors now that summer is here, and stay in touch or make new plans to connect with a friend or family member.
Enjoy healthy foods, and try to get enough sleep.
Mind your mood, doing small, simple things every day that feel good.
If you need more support, the HSE’s www.yourmentalhealth.ie is a good place to start.

﻿Covid19 Vaccine
Important Information about the AstraZeneca vaccine, Vaxzevria
This leaflet tells you about the COVID19 (coronavirus) vaccine.
what COVID19 is
what the COVID19 vaccine is
who should get the vaccine
why it is important to get the vaccine
who should not get it and who should delay getting it
vaccine safety and side effects
where you can get more information
Please read this leaflet carefully.
You can also talk to a healthcare professional, like your GP (Doctor) or Pharmacist, about the vaccine.
What is COVID19?
COVID19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, and sometimes other parts of your body.
It’s caused by a virus called coronavirus.
COVID19 is highly infectious.
It spreads through the air through droplets produced when people cough or sneeze, or when they touch surfaces where the droplets have landed and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
COVID19 can cause serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.
Common symptoms of COVID19 include:
a fever (high temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
a new cough – this can be any kind of cough, not just dry
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you’ve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or they smell or taste differently
You may not have all of these symptoms or you may just feel generally less well than usual.
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to show.
They can be similar to symptoms of cold or flu.
If you have any symptoms of COVID19, selfisolate (stay in your room) and phone a GP (Doctor).
They can arrange a COVID19 test for you.
For more information on COVID19, please visit www.hse.ie/coronavirus or call HSELive on 1850 24 1850.
Who is most at risk from COVID19?
Older people and people with certain health conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get COVID19.
What is the COVID19 vaccine?
A vaccine is a substance that should improve immunity (protection) to a particular disease.
The COVID19 vaccine will offer you protection from COVID19.
If people are vaccinated, it should also reduce the numbers who become seriously ill or even die from COVID19 in our community.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect you from diseases.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn how to protect you through vaccination than by getting COVID19.
Who should get the vaccine?
You can see the list of groups for vaccination on this website: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine
While it is up to you to decide to get the vaccine, the HSE, the World Health Organization and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you do so as soon as it is offered to you.
Vaccines will be given as the supply arrives in Ireland.
When it’s your turn, we will let you know how to get your vaccine through advertising or direct invitation.
It is important not to contact the HSE for a vaccination before then.
You will need to read this leaflet and the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet before you get the vaccine.
You can find the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet on: www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL
You can also talk to a healthcare professional in advance.
If you decide to get the vaccine, you will give your consent, which will be recorded.
The HSE is offering the vaccine free of charge.
Why is it important to get the COVID19 vaccine? Getting a COVID19 vaccine should reduce your risk of getting COVID19 and protect you from serious complications of the illness.
Our aim in offering the vaccine to the population is to protect people and reduce the illness and deaths caused by this virus.
I already had COVID19, so do I need to get the vaccine? Yes.
Even if you have already had COVID19, you could still get it again.
The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting COVID19 again.
Even if you do get COVID19 again, the vaccine can reduce the seriousness of your symptoms.
I have COVID19 now, should I get the vaccine? No.
You should delay getting vaccinated until you recover from COVID19.
at least four weeks after you first notice symptoms or
four weeks since you tested positive for COVID19
Getting the vaccine
Who is my vaccinator?
Your vaccinator is the person who gives you your vaccine.
They are trained by the HSE to give COVID19 vaccines.
Can the COVID19 vaccine give you COVID19? No.
The COVID19 vaccine cannot give you COVID19.
It is possible to have caught COVID19 before getting your vaccine and not realise you have the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.
If you have any symptoms of COVID19, it is important to selfisolate (stay in your room) and arrange a free test to find out if you have COVID19.
If you have a fever which starts more than two days after you get the vaccine, or lasts longer than two days, you should selfisolate and ask a GP (Doctor) to arrange a COVID19 test for you.
If you have COVID19 symptoms after the first dose, you still need to have the second dose.
While you may get some protection from the first dose, having the second dose will give you the best protection against the virus.
Should I get the COVID19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?
You should delay getting the vaccine if you have a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above), until you feel better.
Is it safe to get the vaccine if pregnant or breastfeeding?
If you have had your first dose of the vaccine and are pregnant or breastfeeding you should get your second dose after 12 weeks.
You will be at greater risk of severe illness if you do not get your second dose.
What vaccine am I being offered?
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria.
The vaccine is manufactured by AstraZeneca.
This viral vector vaccine contains a harmless version of a different virus (the vector).
This teaches your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response.
Your body then makes antibodies that help fight the infection if the COVID19 virus enters your body in the future.
Is the vaccine safe?
The HSE only uses vaccines when they meet the required standards of safety and effectiveness.
While the work to develop COVID19 vaccines has moved much faster than usual, the vaccine we are offering you has gone through all the usual steps needed to develop and approve a safe and effective vaccine.
In order to be approved for use, the COVID19 vaccine went through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through, following international standards of safety.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria, manufactured by AstraZeneca.
It has been tested with thousands of people as part of clinical trials
It has met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness, and been approved and licensed by regulators.
For Ireland, the regulator is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – visit www.ema.europa.eu for more information.
How is the COVID19 vaccine given?
The COVID19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
It will only take a few minutes.
How many doses of the COVID19 vaccine will I need?
You will need two doses of the COVID19 vaccine to get longer lasting protection.
You need to get the second dose 12 weeks after the first dose.
What are the side effects of the vaccine?
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.
Most of these are mild to moderate, shortterm, and not everyone gets them.
More than one in 10 people may experience:
feeling tired
tenderness, bruising, pain or itching in the arm where they had the vaccine injection
headache
muscle pain
joint pain
nausea
fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
More than 1 in 100 people may have redness or swelling where they had the injection, diarrhoea, vomiting or a low platelet count (that doesn’t cause any symptoms).
More than 1 in 1000 people may have a reduced appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, swollen lymph glands or a rash.
Serious side effects, like a severe allergic reaction, are very rare, seen in approximately 1 in 100,000 people.
Your vaccinator is trained to treat very rare serious allergic reactions.
Very rarely 1 in 100,000 people may develop very unusual blood clots with low platelets.
1 in 5 of these people may die.
These blood clots are less likely to be reported after the second dose of the vaccine.
The risk of this very rare condition is higher in younger people.
Your GP, Doctor or vaccinator can advise you on the risks and benefits of getting this vaccine.
The COVID19 vaccine has gone through the same clinical trials and safety checks as all other licensed vaccines, however the vaccine is new and long term side effect information is limited.
As more people in Ireland and around the world get this vaccine, more information on side effects may become available.
The HSE will update this information regularly on our website, and if necessary, will update the information leaflets given to people at their first or second dose of the vaccine.
Symptoms of very rare blood clots
Even though the risk of blood clots with low platelets is extremely low, you should know the signs to watch out for.
Get urgent medical help if you get any of these symptoms after the Vaxzevria vaccine:
breathlessness
pain in the chest or stomach
swelling or coldness in a leg
severe or worsening headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures
persistent bleeding, under the skin where there was no previous injury
multiple small bruises, reddish or purplish spots, or blood blisters under the skin
The very rare blood clots with low platelets were usually reported within 14 days of getting the Vaxzevria vaccine.
Watch out for these symptoms in the weeks after your vaccination.
Fever after the vaccine
It’s quite common to develop a fever after a vaccination.
Usually, this happens within two days (48 hours) of getting the vaccine, and it goes away within two days.
You are more likely to get a fever after your first dose of the vaccine.
If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen as directed on the box or leaflet.
If you are concerned, please seek medical advice.
Are there some people who should not get the COVID19 vaccine?
You should not get the COVID19 vaccine if:
you are under 50 years of age.
This is because of the very rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after the vaccine.
You will be offered a different vaccine.
you have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine (including polysorbate 80).
Read the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet to see the list of ingredients.
you have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of this vaccine.
you had blood clots with low platelets after a previous dose of this vaccine.
If you have had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy, you should talk to your Doctor before getting the COVID19 vaccine.
Most people will be able to safely get the vaccine.
The person giving you the vaccine will be happy to answer any questions you have at your appointment for the vaccine.
They will also give you an aftercare advice leaflet, and a vaccine record card showing the name and batch number of the vaccine you have been given.
Should I get a second dose of the vaccine if I am under 50? If you are under 50 and have already had your first dose of the vaccine, you should get your second dose after 12 weeks.
How long does it take the vaccine to work?
It takes 3 weeks, after getting the first dose, for the vaccine to work.
You will have the best protection from COVID19 after the second dose, which you should get 12 weeks after your first dose.
There is a chance you might still get Covid19, even if you have the vaccine.
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Worldwide, vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year, and protect many more from lifelong illnesses.
Millions of people have now received COVID19 vaccines all over the world.
There’s strong, reliable evidence that COVID19 vaccines greatly reduce your risk of getting COVID19.
They’re highly effective at preventing deaths and serious illness with COVID19.
If you have a weakened immune system, there is no extra risk in taking the vaccine but it may not work as well for you.
When I get the vaccine, does that mean I won’t spread COVID19 to others?
We do not know yet if having the vaccine stops you spreading the COVID19 virus to others.
That is why it is important that we all continue to follow public health advice on how to stop the spread of the virus.
follow social distancing guidelines
keep two metres apart from others where possible
wear a face covering
wash your hands regularly
Thank you for protecting yourself and others.
How long does immunity last from the vaccine?
We do not know yet how long immunity will last.
Clinical trials are ongoing to find this out.
For more information, read the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet.
This will be printed for you on the day you get your vaccine, or you can find it on www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL
You can also talk to a health professional, like your GP (Doctor), Pharmacist or healthcare team.
You can also visit the HSE website at www.hse.ie/covid19vaccine or call HSELive on 1850 24 1850.
For more information on the COVID19 vaccine, including materials in other formats and translation support visit
How do I report side effects?
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
The HPRA is the regulatory authority in the Republic of Ireland for medicines, medical devices and other health products.
As part of its role in the safety monitoring of medicines, the HPRA operates a system through which healthcare professionals or members of the public can report any suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with medicines and vaccines which have occurred in Ireland.
The HPRA strongly encourages reporting of suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with Covid19 vaccines to support continuous monitoring of their safe and effective use.
To report a suspected adverse reaction to the Covid19 vaccine, please visit www.hpra.ie/report.
You can also ask your Doctor or a family member to report this for you.
As much information as is known should be provided, and where possible, the vaccine batch number should be included.
The HPRA cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare professional (their Doctor or Pharmacist) with any medical concerns they may have.
In order to administer the vaccine safely and to record all the necessary information to monitor and manage the vaccine, the HSE will be processing your personal information.
All information processed by the HSE will be in accordance to the general laws and in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force in 2018.
The processing of your data will be lawful and fair.
It will only be processed for the specific purpose to manage the vaccinations.
The principle of Data Minimisation has been applied.
This means that only data that is necessary to identify you, book your appointment, record your vaccination and monitor its effects is being recorded.
You have the following rights as a data subject under the GDPR in respect of your personal data that are processed.
Request information on and access to your personal data (commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’).
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
Object to processing of your personal data.
﻿After your COVID19 Vaccine Janssen
Thank you for protecting yourself and others by getting the vaccine.
Now that you have had your vaccine, we ask you to read this document carefully, so you know how you can expect to feel in the next few days and where to get more information.
Do read the COVID19 vaccine information leaflet we gave you about the vaccine too.
We are also giving you a record of your vaccination today.
Please keep the record card safe.
What might happen in the next few days?
Some people who got the vaccine that you got today will:
have swelling, redness and/or pain in the arm where they had the vaccine injection
feel tired
get a headache
have a cough
have muscle pain
have joint pain
have nausea
get a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above).
There have been very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low platelets in the blood in the first few weeks after vaccination.
Platelets help the blood to clot.
You should seek prompt medical assistance and mention your recent vaccination if you:
are breathless
have pain in the chest or stomach
have swelling or coldness in a leg
get a severe or worsening headache (particularly 3 or more days after the vaccine)
have blurred vision, confusion or seizures
have persistent bleeding under the skin where there was no previous injury
have many small bruises, reddish or purplish spots, or blood blisters under the skin.
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
To report side effects to a COVID19 vaccine, please visit www.hpra.ie/report What if I have a fever or have aches and pains?
If you have a fever or you have aches and pains, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help.
However, if your fever lasts more than 48 hours or if you are still concerned, please seek medical advice.
The good news
Getting a COVID19 vaccine should protect you from the serious complications of COVID19.
Vaccines teach your immune system to protect you from diseases.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn this through vaccination than by getting COVID19.
We are still learning
It takes 14 days after getting your vaccine for it to work.
There is a chance you might still get COVID19 even if you have the vaccine.
We do not know yet if having the vaccine stops you spreading the virus to others, so you must continue to follow public health advice:
follow social distancing guidelines
(keep two metres apart from others where possible)
wear a face covering
wash your hands regularly.
If you are unsure about anything, or have any questions about the COVID19 vaccine please ask your vaccinator today.

﻿Keeping well this winter
The next few months will be hard, for all of us, as we live with the impact of COVID19 (coronavirus) on our lives.
But there are ways we can make it a little better for ourselves.
This season, make a plan to help and care for yourself.
Keeping active, getting outside and staying connected with other people can make a positive difference.
Some days, some weeks will be harder than others.
This is especially true at times when we are living with restrictions, have to limit our social interactions and need to keep two metres social distancing even with friends.
Or if we have to self isolate because of symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID19.
This booklet contains health information that you will find useful.
The centre pages also contain space for you to note local phone numbers and contacts that you can use when you need to.

Minding your health
Looking after your physical and mental health is more important than ever now.
Healthy eating and getting regular exercise are vital for health.
Eating well
Eating a variety of nourishing foods provides the energy (calories) and nutrients that you need to stay healthy.
Hot meals and drinks help to keep you warm, so have regular hot drinks and eat at least one hot meal a day if possible.
Eating regularly helps keep energy levels up during winter.
Unexpected weight loss
These tips will help you have healthy eating habits throughout the coming months.
Try to eat 5 to 7 portions of fruit and veg every day.
Plan your meals in advance.
This will help you to introduce variety and eat more nutritious foods.
Prepare your meals using mostly fresh ingredients.
Choose foods like fruits, salads and vegetables for snacks.
Frozen vegetables and fruits like berries are a great option for having in the freezer.
Different foods have different nutrients so if possible try to have a variety of meals throughout the week.
When you are buying fruit and vegetables, try to include a range of colours (think of a rainbow) as the different coloured options have different vitamins.
Use healthier cooking methods such as grilling or baking, rather than frying or roasting with oil or fat.
Choose wholemeal and wholegrain breads, cereals, pasta and brown rice where possible.
Include a small amount of lean protein foods such as poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, beans or meat at two meals in the day.
For older people, protein foods are important at all meals to help keep muscles strong.
Try to eat five to seven portions of fruit, vegetables and salad each day.
At mealtimes, aim for half of your plate to be vegetables or salad.
Make mealtimes special, whether you are eating on your own or with others.
Enjoy your meals at a table and focus on your food rather than watching TV or scrolling on your phone.
Avoid having foods that are high in calories, sugar and fat every day.
They contain very little nutrition and can be very high in calories.
Visit hse.ie/healthyeatingguidelines for more info on healthy eating.
For easy to prepare, tasty and nutritious recipes, search online for ‘Safefood 101 Square Meals cookbook’.
If you or someone you know is experiencing unplanned weight loss that might be related to illness, social isolation or reduced appetite, it is important to tell your GP or public health nurse.
They can recommend some dietary resources that can help, such as a highenergy highprotein cookbook called Making the Most of Every Bite.
The cookbook and other resources are available on hse.ie/nutritionsupports but make sure you seek advice from your GP, nurse or dietitian first.
Unplanned weight gain
Changes in everyday routines, like working from home, stress, physical activity, sleep and eating can affect your weight.
Visit hse.ie/healthyeatingguidelines for information on portion sizes and meal ideas, or talk to your GP or healthcare professional.
Exercise and physical activity
Getting some exercise every day, ideally outdoors, is important for both physical and mental health.
If you are an older adult or if you have an underlying health condition or a disability, exercise and activity may feel harder to do.
But they are really important for things like muscle strength and bone health, which can help to maintain strength, flexibility and prevent falls.
How much exercise do I need?
Make an exercise plan.
These tips will help you to enjoy being more active this winter.
Children and young people aged 2 to 18 should be active, at a moderate to vigorous level, for at least 60 minutes every day.
Moderate activity means your heart is beating faster than normal and breathing is harder than normal.
Vigorous activity means your heart is beating much faster than normal and breathing is much harder than normal.
Every adult should be active at a moderate level at least 30 minutes a day 5 days a week.
Moderate activity means your breathing and heart rate increase, but you are still able to carry on a conversation.
You should feel warm or be sweating slightly at a comfortable pace.
Make a plan to include exercise in your daily routine.
Think about a 20 or 30minute walk each day and also include some other physical activity, such as an online exercise class or sport, two to three times a week if you can.
If you are finding it hard to get into a routine of regular exercise, try to arrange meeting up with a friend or family member, this can help to encourage you.
Household activities like vacuuming, washing windows, and reorganising cupboards all add up to daily
Plan for how you can exercise even when the weather is wet or windy outside.
Can you invest in waterproof clothing and shoes so that you can still go outdoors? Ask friends or family members for recommendations that you can do indoors on those days when you don’t feel like going outside.
Many adults and children who have a disability will also find some exercise enjoyable and helpful for overall physical and mental health.
If you have a disability aim to be as active as the disability allows in order to meet the guideline for your age group.
If you are supporting someone who has a disability, you can check in with their healthcare provider for ideas on what type of activity or exercise is most suitable and safe.
Children’s activity should also include musclestrengthening, flexibility and bonestrengthening exercises three times a week.
Adults also need to include activities which increase muscular strength and endurance on two to three days per week.
The HSE website features a range of indoor exercises suitable for older people.
Search online for ‘HSE indoor exercises’.
Or ask a family member, friend or practice nurse if they can print these for you.
Examples of musclestrengthening exercises
Situps, squats, push ups, lunges, carrying shopping, pushing a lawn mower or lifting hand weights.
Examples of bonestrengthening exercises
All weight bearing activity like running, jogging, jumping or skipping.
Minding your mental health
Lots of us are finding all of the changes to our lives as a result of COVID19 upsetting and difficult to deal with.
Here are some tips to help you mind your mental health during this time.
Daily routine
Having a healthy daily routine is really important for mental health.
During difficult times like this, it’s best if you can keep some structure in your day.
This means eating well, physical activity and exercise, regular sleep habits, and things that you like or enjoy, such as reading a book or being creative.
Stay connected
Stay connected with other people in ways that are safe for you.
If you are not able to meet family or friends because of restrictions, stay in regular contact by phone, letter or email.
Try to listen only to the facts
Keep a realistic perspective of the situation based on facts.
Stay informed but set times and limits for news.
If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed by the news, try to talk about it with someone.
Be mindful
If you smoke or drink, try to avoid doing this more than usual.
Both can affect your mood and overall health and won’t help you in the longterm.
If you would like help to stop smoking, Freephone 1800 201 203 or visit quit.ie
Stay connected and do something you enjoy.
Try to keep a healthy routine, eat well, exercise and get enough sleep.
Changes that you may have noticed
Over the last few months you may have noticed some of the following changes or difficulties for you or someone you care about:
increased anxiety
feeling stressed
finding yourself excessively checking for symptoms, in yourself, or others becoming irritable more easily
feeling insecure or unsettled
fearing that normal aches and pains might be the virus
having trouble sleeping
feeling helpless or a lack of control
having irrational thoughts
Supports are available.
If you need support
GPs are available and can help if you are experiencing mental health problems.
You can phone to make an appointment and they can arrange a phone or video consultation if that suits you better.
Mental health helplines, including the Samaritans, can be a support through crisis or distress.
You can call the Samaritans on 116 123 and calls are free from landline phone or mobile.
Text support services are also an option.
You can text HELLO to 50808 for a calming chat and immediate support if you are going through a mental health or emotional crisis.
This is a HSE funded service.
For more information on mental health and services, please visit the HSE website yourmentalhealth.ie or call the Your Mental Health Information Line on 1800 111 888.
Suicidal thoughts and feelings can sometimes be part of a mental health crisis.
Please remember that if you are in crisis or feeling suicidal, or if you know someone who is at immediate risk of harm, you can call the emergency services on 112 or 999 for help.
General health checks and essentials
Flu vaccine
Flu season lasts from October to April.
Flu can cause serious illness for some people.
The flu vaccine is available free of charge from GPs and pharmacists for people who are at risk of complications from the flu.
This includes adults aged 65 and over, anyone who is pregnant, those with a longterm illness, and for the first time children aged 2 to age 12.
Regular and routine health checks
If you have a longterm health condition like diabetes, epilepsy, or high blood pressure think about any health checks that you might need to have over the coming months.
Contact your GP to arrange a suitable and safe consultation time.
If you need to speak with your GP about any other health concern, please don’t delay.
GPs, hospitals and other health services are open and ready to take care of you.
Most GPs now offer phone or video consultations.
This means you can talk to your GP without leaving your home.
For a phone consultation, you just need to give your phone number to the surgery.
For a video consultation, you will need a smartphone or computer with a reliable internet connection and webcam.
Please remember that if you have any symptoms of COVID19, you should not go to your GP surgery.
Phone your GP for advice instead.
Attending healthcare appointments
There may be some health concerns where a phone or video consultation won’t be suitable.
In this case, there are a few things to remember:
Arrive at the time of your appointment.
If you arrive early, you may be asked to wait in another area or in your car if you travelled that way.
This is to help maintain social distancing within the clinic.
Wear a face mask and use the hand sanitiser which is available in the clinic.
f the clinic has specific ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ doors, use these.
This will help to reduce the number of people you come into contact with.
Go into the clinic on your own, unless you need to have someone with you.
A parent or guardian can accompany a child to their appointment.
Antibiotics do not work for viral infections such as COVID19, colds and flu.
Antibiotics and other medicines
COVID19 Information
How to prevent the spread
Antibiotics are medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria.
You may need antibiotics if you have a bacterial infection that is unlikely to go away without them.
Antibiotics do not work for viral infections such as COVID19, colds and flu, and most coughs and sore throats.
Taking antibiotics when we don’t need them puts us at risk of harm such as skin rash, diarrhoea and other side effects.
Tell your GP if you are prescribed antibiotics and are taking other medication.
Some antibiotics don’t mix well with other medicines.
Your doctor may not know all the medicines that you are taking as they may have been prescribed by different doctors.
Ask your GP or pharmacist if the antibiotic is safe to take with your other medicine.
Prescriptions
If you are on regular medication for a health condition, keep a list of your medicines in a safe place.
This is really helpful if you need to go to the doctor or to the pharmacist.
There is space in this booklet to keep your list, see page 19, or you can just keep it on a piece of paper at home.
If you have a mobile phone, take and keep a photo of your list.
You don’t have to go to your GP in order to get a repeat prescription.
You can phone and tell them what you need.
They can arrange to send the prescription to your local pharmacy for you.
You or someone you trust can collect it from there.
Medical cards and GP visit cards
For information about medical cards and other health payment supports, search online for ‘HSE schemes and allowances’.

Free HSE COVID19 testing
You will be referred for a free COVID19 test if you have symptoms and, following a phone consultation, your GP advises that you need a test.
If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, the HSE public health tracing team might contact you and arrange for you to be tested.
Keep your phone close to you and make sure it is switched on.
You will find more detailed information on testing on the HSE website, search for ‘HSE COVID testing’.
Or you can Freephone HSELive on 1850 24 1850 for information.
Cough
This can be any kind of cough, usually dry but not always
Sudden loss of smell
Fever
High temperature over 38 degrees celsius
Sudden loss of taste
Shortness of breath
You may display one, some or all of these symptoms.
Breathing difficulties
Self isolation
Self isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people, including the people you live with.
If you live with other people, stay on your own in a room with a window that you can open for fresh air, if possible.
If you develop symptoms, you should selfisolate to protect other people, and phone your GP.
See the next pages for information on self isolating.
Other people you live with will need to restrict their movements
Your GP consultation is free of charge if you have any of these symptoms.
Please phone your GP and do not go to your GP surgery, because if you do have the virus you could pass it on to someone else.
Your GP will advise over the phone if you need to have a test.
If you need a test, it is also free of charge.
You have to self isolate when there is a high risk that you could spread the virus to other people.
Self isolate:
if you have symptoms of COVID19
while you wait for a test appointment and your test results, if you have symptoms of COVID19.
If you are being tested as a close contact and you don’t have any symptoms, you should restrict your movements instead (see next page)
if you have had a positive test result for COVID19, even if you have mild symptoms or no symptoms
People in your household will need to restrict their movements (stay at home) for 14 days.
This is because it can take up to two weeks for symptoms of COVID19 to show.
When you can stop self isolation:
Most people can stop self isolating when both of these apply:
you have had no fever for five days
it has been ten days since you first developed symptoms
If you tested positive because you are a close contact, you may have no symptoms.
In this case, you can stop selfisolating ten days from the date of your test.
Restricted movements
Restricting your movements means staying at home to avoid contact with other people.
Restricting your movements helps to stop the spread of COVID19.
You can still go outside to exercise by yourself as long as you keep 2 metres away from other people.
Restrict your movements for 14 days if you:
are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID19
live with someone who has symptoms of COVID19 but you feel well
arrive in Ireland from a country that is not on the green list
If you are caring for someone who cannot self isolate you should restrict your movements for 17 days.
Restrict your movements for 14 days if you are a close contact of a person who tested positive for COVID19.
Do this from when you were last in contact with that person.
You must do this even if your test comes back negative.
This is because it can take up to 14 days for the virus to show up in your system after you have been exposed to it.
For more detailed information, please visit hse.ie/coronavirus or call HSELive
Self isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people.
COVID19, colds, flu: What’s the difference?
Colds, coughs and flu are common in winter time.
Flu season generally lasts from October to April.
This year, we should all make a particular effort to avoid getting coughs, colds and flu.
We can help to do this by washing hands, keeping social distance, eating a healthy, nutritious diet, and getting regular exercise.
If you are at risk of serious complications from the flu you can also get the flu vaccine free of charge from your GP or pharmacist.
You are at higher risk if you are aged 65 or over, if you have a longterm illness, if you are pregnant, and for children aged 2 to 12 years old.
If someone around you has a cold or flu, try to avoid becoming infected yourself by keeping away from them, and cleaning and disinfecting any shared surfaces or items, such as cutlery.
Avoid sharing toothbrushes, food items or drinks with other people in your home.
The actions we take to protect ourselves and others from COVID19 (hand washing, washing and disinfecting surfaces regularly, cough and sneeze etiquette) will also help to protect us from colds and flu.
Helpful resources
Get outside every day, if it is safe to do so and I am well enough.
Stick to a regular healthy routine of diet, exercise and sleep and eat lots of fruit and vegetables.
Get a good night’s sleep.
Connect with at least one family member, friend or neighbour every day, if possible.
Have a list of medicines and my Eircode in a very handy place, in case I need them.
Find something that I enjoy, watching tv, reading a book, doing some art, cooking, knitting or sewing, listening to audiobooks or podcasts.
Notice and acknowledge good things that happen each day, write them down if it helps.

﻿COVID Tracker app Help us reduce the spread of COVID19 in Ireland
The HSE has made a free smartphone app that helps improve contact tracing for COVID19.
If you use the app, you can help protect people you come into contact with and reduce the spread of coronavirus.
The app protects your privacy and you keep control of your information.
What is an app?
An app or application allows a mobile phone to do certain tasks.
Apps on your phone might include Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp.
If you use the app, you can:
get an alert if you have been in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID19
alert others if you test positive for coronavirus – this will help keep other people safe
track your symptoms and get advice on what to do if you’re sick
get regular updates, and protect yourself and others as we learn to live with COVID19
What does the COVID Tracker app do?
Contact tracing
It helps speed up contact tracing and reach more people with the right advice.
When someone tests positive for COVID19, HSE contact tracing teams identify their close contacts.
This could be family, friends or others that you have spent time with.
The contact tracing team tells these close contacts what to do and advises on testing for COVID19.
The app helps to find close contacts you might have forgotten, or who are unknown to you.
The app does this while protecting your privacy.
COVID CheckIn
You can use the app to record any symptoms you have of COVID19 and get advice on what to do.
This information is anonymous and will be used to help us understand how COVID19 is spreading and affecting people in Ireland.
Updates on COVID19
App users will have access to the latest information about COVID19 in Ireland.
How will you protect my privacy?
The app exchanges secure, anonymous records when people using the app are in close contact with each other.
The app will never identify you to other app users and you cannot access each other’s information.
The app does not collect your name, location or movements.
Your records are collected anonymously and stored on your mobile phone.
If you test positive for COVID19, you can choose to upload your records to anonymously alert your close contacts.
You can choose to put your mobile phone number into the app.
The contact tracing team will call you, if you receive a close contact alert, to give you advice and arrange a test, if needed.
If you choose to use the COVID CheckIn function to record any symptoms you have, you can share your town or county, age group and sex, to help the HSE understand the spread of COVID19 in Ireland.
How do I download the COVID Tracker app?
There are two ways to download the app.
Go to www.covidtracker.ie on your phone and follow the steps on the page.
Go to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store on your mobile phone.
Search ‘COVID Tracker Ireland’ and click ‘Install’ or ‘Get’.
When you do this, the COVID Tracker yellow icon will appear on your phone screen.
Follow the steps in the app to set it up.
Can I delete the COVID Tracker app from my phone?
You can uninstall the app at any time.
This will delete the data that the app has stored on your phone.
The data that you have shared with other phones will also be deleted.
Stopping the spread of COVID19
The app will help us to track and stop the spread of COVID19 as we continue to reopen services and communities.
It goes hand in hand with the other important steps we can all take.
Everyone should continue to:
wash hands regularly
cover coughs and sneezes
practice social distancing
wear face coverings in shops, public transport and other places difficult to keep our distance
We have all helped to reduce the spread of COVID19 in Ireland.
The more people who download and use the app, the more it will help to reduce the spread of COVID19.
Download the app today and help us to quickly trace and help those with COVID19.

﻿Updated FAQs for School Principals or Designated Contact Person
This leaflet was developed for school principals or designated contact person by the HSE in collaboration with the Department of Education.
New or significantly changed information:
Close contact testing:
What is the period of restricted movements required of a pupil/student or staff member deemed to be a “close contact”?
Pupils/students will be asked to restrict their movements.
In line with national recommendations for close contacts, testing is offered at Day 0 and Day 10.
If a close contact received a ‘not detected’ result from both tests, then they can end their restricted movements and return to school.
If they have a ‘detected’ test result, they will then be managed as a case of COVID19.
If they do not undertake COVID19 testing, then they are required to restrict their movements for a full 14 days.
Anyone who is a close contact of a person that tested positive for COVID19 has to restrict their movements and follow the process as above.
Restricted movements start from the last date they were in contact with a confirmed case of COVID19.
As several close contacts are usually identified in an education setting, the date of D10 testing can change, depending on the results public health receives from everyone’s Day 0 testing.
Often the date of D10 testing will be pushed out.
All close contacts will be informed of their new date of D10 testing and prolonged restricted movements, if this is the case.
A close contact can stop restricting their movement and return to school when both of the following apply:
They have a negative test (COVID19 not detected) 10 days after they were last in contact with a person who tested positive for COVID19.
They do not have any symptoms of COVID19
As per data protection regulations, a school cannot confirm the name of the pupil/student and/or staff member who tested positive (‘detected’) for COVID19.
Do ‘close contacts’ of close contacts need to be excluded from schools?
Nationally it is not recommended the close contacts of close contacts need to also restrict their movements, and therefore siblings of close contacts identified through the schools setting can still attend school.
If there are particular concerns following the case and school PHRA being undertaken, the public health doctor may sometimes request siblings also restrict their movements, but this will be a specific clinical recommendation.
It is not routine and siblings of schools close contacts identified should not be excluded by schools.
Previous infection with COVID19
What if a staff or student says they have had COVID19 previously?
Staff / students and in the case of young children, the parents should be told to discuss with the HSE schools teams.
If there is clear evidence of a confirmed infection with COVID19 within the past 6 months, as per national guidelines, then as long as staff/student has no symptoms, then they are not determined as a close contact and do not need to restrict their movements.
This does not apply if there are specific concerns the case may have a particular variant of concern e.g.
Brazilian P1 variant or South African B.1.351.
In these circumstances restricted movements will apply, but public health teams will determine this.
For the majoriy of staff and students who have had a confirmed case of COVID19 within the last six months, they will not need to restrict their movements and can return to school.
Singing
Guidance for singing / wind instruments at primary level
Guidance with regard to singing at primary school level remains the same as circulated before Christmas.
This stated that ‘singing whilst maintaining social distancing and within normal pod structures can take place outdoors.
Unfortunately, no parents / guardians will be allowed to attend these outdoor events either’.
It is important that this advice continues, especially as we move closer to end of term festivities.
Guidance for singing / wind instruments at postprimary level
Guidance for singing / wind instruments at post primary level are outlined within the document ‘Return to School Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post Primary Schools and Centres for Education; March 2021’ and should be followed.
Travel
What’s the advice for people travelling into Ireland?
There is a Government Advisory in operation against all nonessential international travel.
If travel is essential, then the advice needs to be followed, depending on whether travel was from a category 1 or category 2 country.
Testing / restriction requirements for people returning from countries are explained on the gov.ie website.
These apply to staff and students who might be returning after travel.
These are legal requirements, and apply to all citizens and residents returning to Ireland.
The requirements as of 17.3.21 state that returning travellers from category 1 countries ‘may leave to take a RTPCR test no less than 5 days after your arrival – if you receive written confirmation that the result of this test is negative/ ‘not detected’ your period of quarantine can end.
You must retain the written confirmation of your test result for at least 14 days.
If your journey began in any of the Category 2 countries , you must complete the full 14 days of quarantine – regardless of whether you have a negative test result.’
As these measures and countries included as Category 1 or category 2 will change, up to date advice should always be sought from here.
HSE schools teams will have no different advice to this national advice.
Data
Schools data is presented weekly on the HSE website here.
It presents information on the number of facilities a PHRA and onward testing has been undertaken and the close contact positivity ie.
For each index case identified to us who attended school in their infectious time period, how many of the identified close contacts tested positive for Covid19.
So far, since schools phased return from 8th February, data up to 13th March shows 118 facilities across SEN, Primary and Post primary have had a PHRA and onward testing undertaken; identifying 2,625 close contacts with 61 cases (2.3%) subsequently testing positive for Covid19.
The reports also present the total number of children who have tested positive for Covid19 in the week, and since Covid19 were first notifiable.
Between March 2020 and 13th March 2021, 24,900 5 18 year olds have had a confirmed diagnosis of Covid19.
This is 2.7% of all children aged 518 years.
The reports are uploaded weekly on to the website.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy related guidelines for the Education Sector have been published and are available on the HSE website here.
Detected result confirmation
If the school is informed of a positive case, what should the school do?
Await instructions from public health don’t panic – classes do not need to be sent home or told not to come in to school.
It is important to remember that the confirmed case is no longer within the school and therefore the risk of onward transmission from that person has been removed from the school setting.
If the case was not in the school setting whilst infectious, then public health will not routinely call the school because there is no significant risk that the case has spread the infection in the school setting.
If the case of COVID19 was in the school during the infectious period the school should await a call from the Department of Public Health.
This will usually be on the same day but may be the next day.
The ‘infectious period’ is the timeframe during which someone with an infectious disease can spread it to other people – the ‘infectious period’ for COVID19 includes the 24 hours before testing for asymptomatic cases, or the 48 hours before symptom onset for symptomatic cases.
The ‘incubation period’ (when someone might be infected with the virus but not unwell) is 14 days (average 47 days) and therefore even if a staff member or student was in the school within the infectious time period, it takes an average of 47 days before any other person might become unwell from becoming infected.
This allows Public Health the time to undertake the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA), through same day or following day response.
When public health doctors make contact with the school they will proceed to ask several questions and undertake a PHRA with the school.
What should I expect when Public Health call me?
The regional Department of Public Health will ask several questions and carry out a risk assessment.
Public Health will identify any close contacts from the school setting with you, through the process of the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA).
You will be asked by the Department of Public Health to provide information on the close contacts identified.
This information will be required in a specific excel format.
The legal basis for sharing requested data with Public Health (Medical Officers of Health and staff in Departments of Public Health) is the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 as amended which provides the legal responsibility for Public Health in Article 11 and the authority in Article 19 which states that ‘Any person who refuses to comply with a requirement or direction given or a request for information made in pursuance of any of the provisions of these Regulations shall be guilty of a contravention of these Regulations’.
This legislation fulfils GDPR Article 6 conditions c, d, and e regarding lawfulness of processing, and processing of special categories of personal data is allowed under Article 9 2 (i).
What is a Public Health Risk Assessment?
Schools teams within regional departments of Public Health will undertake a PHRA with the school to explore the following:
unique information and factors relevant to the case and that particular educational facility and its infrastructure, with regard to infection transmission
interactions of the community of pupils and teachers both within the school and how they interlink within the wider community
patterns of infection within the wider local community and
consider general community infection rates in the regions serviced by the educational facility.
This information will inform the decisions regarding the identification of close contact and any further action required including the need for full, or partial, closure of any school.
The definition of close contacts is on the hpsc website, and this is used, with the information identified through the PHRA to determine who the close contacts are within the school setting.
It will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts.
This is because the school settings are so varied e.g.
in young primary school children, ‘pods’ will likely be deemed close contacts and all removed.
In secondary settings where there is social distancing rather than a ‘pod’ per se, close contacts will be determined by proximity and interaction with the index case; class placement; classroom structure; common travel; social networks and friendship groups etc.
What happens if teachers or students receive notifications of the HSE COVID Tracker App?
Close contacts within the school setting are identified by Departments of Public Health following a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA).
If there is any information from the HSE COVID Tracker App, this information will be considered in the risk assessment.
However, it may be that not all people who are alerted through the App are actually deemed close contacts, or vice versa – Public Health might determine that some people who have not been notified by the App are close contacts.
While the COVID tracker App is a very useful tool for collecting information on potential close contacts, Public Health risk assessment and advice overrides the App.
This is because the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) collects more nuanced, composite information to better appraise infection transmission risk in defined circumstances.
Will the Department of Public Health provide instructions to the school as to how to proceed?
Once the Public Health Risk Assessment is complete, the Department of Public Health will then advise you of the public health instructions.
These instructions are delivered by the Medical Officer of Health/ Health officer on the advice of the MOH, under Infectious Diseases legislation.
The advice will typically include asking the school principal to:
Contact the parents/guardians of the pupils/students, who are determined by Public Health to be ‘close contacts’.
Parents of these pupils/students will be asked by the school principal to collect them from school as soon as is safely and practically possible, so they can start restricting their movements.
This may still be at the end of the school day.
Public Health may also ask the school to issue a letter / text message or written guidance to these parents/guardians, prepared and provided by Public Health.
Contact any staff member who may be determined by Public Health to be a “close contact” and ask him/her to go home to start restricting their movements.
If there is a case identified how far back do Public Health go to consider close contacts?
For a confirmed case of COVID19 who was symptomatic, Public Health will identify close contacts in the 48hour period before the person became symptomatic.
If the confirmed case was asymptomatic, then public health will identify close contacts for the 24hour period before the test was taken.
Is contact tracing within the school community always required?
It may well be that for someone who is identified as a confirmed case of COVID19 there is no need to do any contact tracing within the school setting.
This would be because the person was not in school while infectious and therefore no contact tracing of other persons within the school will be required.
In this instance Public Health would not contact the school.
I have heard that someone from the school has been identified as a confirmed case of COVID19 – why has Public Health not contacted me?
It may have already been determined that there are no close contacts or onward transmission risk within the school setting, for example if the individual was not in the school during the infectious period.
When Public Health do need to contact a school, they will usually do so the same day, or following day.
This is safe practice, as the case is no longer within the school setting, and therefore the risk of onward transmission from this case is no longer present.
Can the school share a name of the pupil/student or staff member who is a confirmed case of COVID19?
No, the school cannot share the name of the person who has tested positive for COVID19 (Covid19 detected).
This information is private and confidential.
Close contacts will not be told the name of the confirmed case.
Is the school complying with GDPR requirements when collecting and sharing information on complex/close contacts with the HSE?
Yes, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, as amended, Medical Officers of Health ask that you collect the data, keep it secure and release it only to Public Health when requested to do so as part of the investigations into a confirmed or suspected case of COVID19.
Processing of these data by the MOH is provided for under GDPR, special category data 9 2(i).
What if the press media or wider school community contact the school?
The following is a generic statement that schools may wish to consider using in full or part in response to press/media queries.
“The school cannot comment on individual cases or outbreaks of COVID19 to protect the privacy and confidentiality of those involved.
The school can confirm that we have engaged with the HSE.
The HSE’s role includes carrying out a Public Health Risk Assessment.
As part of this risk assessment, all close contacts will be identified, contacted and advised of the next steps.
Close contacts are requested not to come to school, in line with HSE Public Health advice.
If Public Health does not make contact with you, you are not impacted and can continue to attend school.
The school will continue to work with the HSE in ensuring all necessary hygiene, health and safety protocols are in place at the school for the prevention and containment of COVID19.”
If a pupil/student and/or staff member develops symptoms
What should the school do if a pupil/student is displaying symptoms while at school?
The pupil/student should be immediately brought to the designated isolation area in the school, which should have good ventilation and preferably a window to the outside that opens.
The school should contact the parents/ guardians and ask them to collect their child as soon as possible.
The pupil/student should be cared for appropriately by a designated staff member until they are collected.
The staff member who is caring for the child should take all necessary precautions as outlined in the public health guidance document.
The staff member assisting with the pupil/student does not need to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves, or are later advised to by public health.
After the symptomatic pupil/student has left the isolation space, it should be cleaned and contact surfaces disinfected.
What should the school do if a staff member is displaying symptoms while at school?
The onus is on the staff member to immediately inform the principal that s/he is displaying symptoms.
The staff member should immediately go home, self isolate and seek medical review by their GP (phone the GP if you have symptoms of COVID19, do not attend in person.
GP assessment for COVID19, and COVID testing if required, are free of cost.)
What should the school do if they are informed over the phone that a pupil/student is symptomatic?
The Principal is asked only to make a note of the pupil/student’s absence.
The principal may note a brief description of the pupil/student’s symptoms, if they are disclosed by the parent.
However, the principal is not required or entitled to ask about clinical symptoms.
Schools can remind parents that if they are concerned a child may have symptoms of COVID19, the child should not attend school and they should contact their GP without delay.
No further actions are required of the school at this stage.
Should a school advise the school community that a staff or pupil/student is symptomatic?
Schools are asked to note that they should not inform other parents or staff members that a pupil/student or staff member has gone home due to their symptoms.
Other pupils/students or staff do not need to be removed from class.
This includes siblings or other household members of staff or pupils/students.
Should siblings/household members of someone with symptoms be removed from the school setting?
Only under certain circumstances: if the GP of the pupil/student/ staff member decides that their symptoms are consistent with COVID19, (for example, fever OR a new cough, shortness of breath, deterioration of existing respiratory condition any loss of or changes to the sense of smell or taste), that person becomes a suspected case of COVID19 and will be referred for a test.
It is at this point that members of the symptomatic person’s household, including siblings or children of staff members, should be withdrawn from school by their parents or guardians and start restricting their movements, until the test results are known.
How will a test be set up for these pupils/student and/or /staff members?
The pupil/student or staff member will be advised to contact their GP.
Their GP will assess them and determine whether they should be referred for a COVID19 test.
If an individual is referred for a COVID19 test, s/he will receive a text message with information of the appointment (time and place).
If a pupil/student has symptoms which may be consistent with COVID19 – what does the parents/ guardian need to do?
If a child has symptoms which could be consistent with COVID19, the parents/guardians should call their GP.
Their GP will decide whether they should be tested for COVID19.
If the GP determines that the child does need a COVID19 test, it is at this point that all of their household contacts are asked to restrict their movements.
This means that siblings or staff members in the same household as the person who has symptoms should be removed from the school setting.
Only the symptomatic case is asked to selfisolate.
Note: there will be many cases where testing is determined not to be required, for example, because the GP thinks that the child’s symptoms are not due to COVID19 and might be due to another cause..
If the GP does not recommend COVID testing, and it is early in the child’s illness, the recommendation is to observe the child for 48 hours and if no further symptoms develop, then they can return to school.
If the GP has made a different diagnosis, parents/guardians should follow advice and recommendations on exclusion depending on this diagnosis.
How soon will the pupil/student or staff member receive a test? A: The person will receive an automated notification of a scheduled appointment at a testing centre at the next possible free slot for testing.
Will the pupil/student or staff member receive one test or more than one test on the basis of being symptomatic? If the latter, why?
If the pupil/student or staff member is experiencing symptoms and has been referred for testing by their GP, they will receive one test.
If a pupil/student/ staff member is identified as a close contact
How will a test be set up for persons identified as a close contact?
The HSE will send an SMS with the appointment date, time and location of the free COVID19 test(s)
How soon will the pupil/student/staff member receive a test after being identified as a close contact?
Public Health will advise on the timing of a test for close contacts.
This will depend on when the pupil/student/staff member was last in contact with the positive case.
Testing will be arranged within 12 days.
Close contacts are recommended to have two tests; one at day 0 and the second at day 10.
Will the pupil/student/staff member receive one test or more than one test? If the latter, why?
Public Health will advise whether a pupil/student/staff member needs one or more tests for COVID19.
They will usually require testing on Day 0 and Day 10 since their last exposure to the confirmed case, but there may be circumstances whereby Public Health require only one test to be undertaken, for example.
if sufficient time has elapsed such that the first test for close contacts will be 7 days since they were last exposed to the individual they will only require one test.
Public Health doctors will make this judgement following the risk assessment.
If a test comes back as “not detected” for a symptomatic pupil/student/staff member, will the person still be required to restrict their movements and why?
If the person receives a negative / ‘not detected’ test result, the person should remain at home until they are well enough to return to school, unless parents/guardians of (pupil/students) or staff members are specifically asked by HSE public health to remain excluded because of further investigation.
A pupil/student /staff member can return to their normal activities, once they have been given either:
a negative (‘notdetected’) test result and are 48 hours without symptoms
another diagnosis, which is not COVID19.
Those who live with the person will then no longer need to restrict their movements.
If a test comes back ‘SARSCoV2 detected’ (confirmed case of COVID19) will the pupil /student/staff member still be required to selfisolate?
If a person was symptomatic for COVID19 they should already be selfisolating.
If a close contact who was restricting their movements receives a positive COVID19 test result (SARSCoV2 detected), they are now a confirmed case of COVID19 and must selfisolate; additionally, their close contacts including household contacts must now also start restricting their movements.
They may already have been restricting their movements, however if only one person in the house was deemed a close contact from an exposure outside the house e.g.
in the school, then the other family members would not have been restricting their movements until this point.
If a pupil/student//staff member has tested positive for COVID19 and self isolated for 10 days thereafter, can they return to school/work?
Yes, provided the following applies:
they have selfisolated for 10 days from onset of symptoms with last 5 days without a fever (high temperature (38 degrees Celsius or over)
if they were asymptomatic they must have selfisolated for 10 days from date of test)
Close contact information
What is the definition of a close contact?
A person is deemed to be a close contact within an education setting if s/he has
had face to face contact for <1m with a confirmed case of COVID19 for >15 minutes in a school day.
been between 1 and 2 metres from a confirmed case of COVID19 for >15 minutes in a school day with consideration of other mitigation measures e.g.
facecoverings, pods, ventilation, IPC measures or uncertain compliance with mitigation measures in place (assessed through clinical PHRA)
Contacts are assessed from contact with a confirmed case of COVID19 during their infectious period 48 hours before the onset of symptoms if symptomatic, or 24 hours before the test for COVID19 was taken in those who are asymptomatic.
Can the class of a confirmed Covid19 case attend school?
The HSE will have carried out a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA).
The only individuals who cannot attend school are those who have been identified as close contacts by Public Health.
This may be a small number, for example a ‘pod’, or it could be a full class.
However, if a pupil/student /staff member develops symptoms which could be consisted with Covid19, they should selfisolate immediately and discuss the matter with their GP.
What message can be communicated to the wider school? (if required) or What should the principal do if parents of pupils/students or staff members, that have not been identified as close contact, ring the school for information on the confirmed (positive) case and other close contacts?
A suggested communication would include “The HSE is guiding our school through the actions we need to take to protect staff, students and our school community.
A Public Health Risk Assessment has been carried out.
All close contacts have been identified and sent home from school to restrict their movements for 14 days.
The school community will continue to engage with and implement Public Health advice to protect ourselves and the school community from Covid19“
Can siblings or children of a staff member who is a close contact attend school?
Only the pupil/student/staff member who is a close contact needs to restrict their movements, even though they have no symptoms.
However, no other family member is required to do so – unless also identified as a close contact.
If however the pupil/student/staff member who is a close contact develops symptoms, of COVID19 then they are a suspected case of COVID19 and should now selfisolate and contact their GP, explaining that they have been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID19 and they now have symptoms too.
If the GP determines they are now a suspected case of COVID19, they will arrange testing and the close contact should:
continue to self isolate; and
household members should restrict their movements, as per guidance for household contacts of a suspected case of COVID19.
Will a pupil/student’s / staff members result be shared with the educational facility?
COVID19 tests remain confidential as per patient – doctor confidentiality.
No other pupil/student, parent, family or teacher will be informed of the results.
However, parents should be advised at the point of testing, that if their child’s result is positive for COVID19(SARSCoV219 detected) then it will likely need to be shared with an appropriate named individual within the school/educational facility, if this is deemed necessary by the Medical Officer of Health for onward safe management of the situation.

Roadmap for the Full Return to School
There are almost 1 million students attending school in the primary and post primary sectors, across approximately 4,000 schools, in which close to 100,000 staff are employed.
The announcement on March 12th of the closure of all schools, colleges, universities and other training and learning facilities was the commencement of a series of challenges across the education sector as a result of COVID19.
The interests of students and their families, as well as the safety of the staff, have always been paramount as we have worked through these challenges.
This Roadmap set outs how schools will reopen for all students from the end of August and what the operation of our schools will look like and be sustainable in a COVID19 context.
It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the Roadmap for Society and Business1, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with education stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives.
It also reflects a consideration of approaches adopted in other jurisdictions, which have been finalised in recent weeks.
The reopening process is a massive logistical operation, on both a national basis and local level for individual schools.
The Public Health Advice related to reopening of schools provided by the HPSC;
The COVID19 Response Plans for Primary and Special Schools and Post Primary Schools, in line with the Return to Work Safely Protocol, to be implemented in advance of schools reopening.
The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out 6 overriding principles as follows:
Safe informed and guided by a public health assessment of risk
Rational includes consideration of the social and economic benefits and impacts of any modifications of restrictions and their feasibility
Evidence informed uses all of the data and research available to us to guide thinking
Fair ethical and respects human dignity, autonomy and supports equality
Open & transparent decisions are clear, well communicated and subject to the necessary checks and balances
Whole of Society based on the concept of solidarity and supporting cohesion as we exit over time
The Measures to be implemented in Schools to (i) minimise the risk of introduction of infection in our schools; and
managing risk of spread if introduced through:
Regular and good hand hygiene;
Good respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette;
Enhanced cleaning regimes; and
Maintaining physical distancing in the classroom and within schools;
The suite of Additional Supports available to schools to implement their Covid 19 Response Plan and operate in a sustainable way;
The arrangements to Get Children Safely to our Schools;
How the Mental Health and Wellbeing of Students and Staff will be supported throughout the reopening process,
Guidance on Learning and School Programmes in 2020/21;
How schools can support those staff and students who cannot attend school for health reasons related to COVID19 and in the event of a school closure in the future;
The Communication Arrangements in place to ensure schools, school communities and all stakeholders have clear, relevant and timely information to support the reopening and continued operation of schools; and
A summary on what schools will be like when they reopen.
Schools will reopen for all students from the end of August.
Public Health Advice
On June 24th 2020, the HPSC issued COVID19 recommendations for the reopening of schools and educational facilities (the ‘Public Health Advice’) to the Department of Education to inform the development of sector specific guidance for educational settings.
The interim Public Health Advice was developed in the context of the current COVID19 epidemiology in Ireland, and it specifically notes that it will be updated to reflect the changing situation.
The Department and Minister has continued to engage with health authorities since the publication of the interim recommendations.
The Department will continue to work with the health authorities and implement as appropriate any changes necessary to support school reopening in line with any changes to public health advice to manage the spread of COVID19.
It has been confirmed that at the current time, there is no change to the public health advice for the reopening of schools and educational facilities that was provided at the end of June 2020 by the HPSC.
The public health authorities will keep this under review as evidence emerges from other countries where schools have reopened.
The measures set out in the Public Health Advice are “aimed at risk minimization of COVID19, for young people, teachers, other staff, their families and the wider community, recognizing the importance of education for health and wellbeing and that free primary education provided by the State is a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution” and provides clear guidance for safe school operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID19 in schools, predicated on two general recommendations:
Minimising the risk of introduction of COVID19 into the school community; and
Managing the risk of spread if introduced through:
Regular hand hygiene;
Maintaining physical distancing;
Application of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette; and
Environmental hygiene.
All Departmental Guidance Documents referred to in the Roadmap, specifically the COVID19 Response Plans and Templates, have been developed in line with the Public Health Advice.
Beyond the specific detailed guidance within the Public Health Advice, there are a number of broad themes outlined in the advice which are critical to our ability to minimising risk associated with COVID19 in our schools:
Roadmap for Full Return to Schools
A Balanced Approach
“One of the key challenges for schools during this pandemic is to balance the need for a practical and sensible level of caution with the need to provide a supportive environment for pupils/students and where teachers feel able to engage with pupils in a way that supports their learning”
Apply CommonSense
“An atmosphere of fear and an overwhelming preoccupation with infection and hygiene can be harmful to teachers and pupils and to the quality of the educational experience without materially reducing the risk of infection beyond what can be achieved with a commonsense approach”
Create Awareness
“A heightened awareness by staff, parents and children (where age appropriate) is required so that they know how to protect themselves and each other and how to recognise and report symptoms of COVID19 infection”
Do Everything Practical to Avoid Introduction of COVID19 into the school “The most critical part of managing the risks of COVID19 related to schools is doing everything practical to avoid introduction of COVID19 into the school.
If the infection is not introduced it cannot spread.
The risk of introduction is related to how common the infection is in the community served by the school at a given time.
If the infection is uncommon in the community then the likelihood of introduction is much lower”
Stay at Home if Unwell
“No person (child, teacher or parent) should attend an educational setting if unwell or any members of their household are unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID19”
Keep doing the key measures to keep us all safe
“Social (Physical) distancing, hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette should be observed by all (children, teachers, parents and visitors)”
Roadmap for Full Return to Schools
A key element to ensuring that school remain open once they reopen is for everyone in the school community (students, their families and staff) to continue to play their role in keeping the virus out of their school by adopting behaviours in harmony with these broad themes.
The Return to Work Safely Protocol, prepared by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Health, is designed to:
support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID19 in the workplace; and
to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID 19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE.
It sets out the steps that must be taken before a workplace reopens, and through its operation, including:
mandatory COVID19 induction training;
the appointment of at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that COVID19 measures are strictly adhered to in their place of work; and
processes to deal with suspected cases of COVID19.
Schools are places of learning for students whilst all schools are also places of work.
The Return to Work Safely Protocol will be implemented in all schools.
To support schools to implement the Protocol the Department has developed COVID19 Response Plan template documentation tailored to reflect the differences between Post Primary Schools and Primary and Special Schools.
The completion and implementation of the Covid19 Response Plan by a school is the means through which schools can best prevent the introduction and spread of Covid19 in the school environment.
It is a very important living document which will be adapted over time to reflect the evolving COVID19 context.
The COVID19 Response Plan templates has been developed in line with Public Health Advice, the guidance provided by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA).
They have been prepared and shared with the education partners.
This centralised approach was adopted to reduce the administrative burden on schools and enable a consistency of approach across the sector.
a draft COVID19 Policy Document to be updated by each school;
the relevant prereturn to work steps to be completed by both the school management and staff;
the process for the appointment of a ‘Lead Worker Representative’ at school level, as agreed by the Department and staff representatives;
a risk assessment template to identify any risks to be managed at school level (developed in conjunction with the HSA);
various checklists to allow for planning and reopening of schools, including induction training, dealing with suspected cases and cleaning of schools are also included;
Guidance on restricted access to the school facility for persons other than staff and students for essential purposes and limited to those who have prior approval from the Principal; and
Guidance related to the prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals whereby schools will be required to maintain a log of staff and pupil/student contacts and a detailed sign in/sign out log of those visiting the school facility will require to be maintained.
Where there is a suspected case of COVID19 in a school, the COVID19 Response Plan Guidance also sets out steps schools should take as follows:
Bring the person to the designated isolation area available in each school;
Arrangements to contact parents/guardians in the event of a suspected case in a pupil/student;
Facilitate the person remaining in isolation if they cannot go home immediately;
Supporting the making of arrangements for transport home or if they are too unwell to go home to contact 999 or 112 to advise it is a COVID19 suspected case;
Carrying out an assessment of the incident to determine follow up actions; and
Arrangements for the appropriate cleaning of the isolation and work areas.
Where there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID19 amongst school staff or pupils, schools need to maintain both staff and pupil confidentiality at all times and must follow the instructions of HSE Public Health.
inform any staff/parents or students who come into close contact with a diagnosed case via the contact tracing process;
contact all relevant persons where a diagnosis of COVID19 is made; and
advise on the appropriate action, on a casebycase basis, that should be taken visàvis the operation of the school.
Measures and Operational Changes to be implemented in Schools
The measures set out in the Public Health Advice are predicated on two general recommendations:
Minimising the risk of introduction of COVID19 into the school community; and
Managing the risk of spread if introduced through:
Regular hand hygiene;
Maintaining physical distancing;
Application of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette; and
Environmental hygiene.
In terms of Minimising the risk of introduction of COVID19 into the school community, it is critical that people stay at home if unwell.
Nobody should go to school if they are unwell or any members of their household are unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID19.
In managing the risk of spread of COVID19 if introduced into the school community, this section sets out the specific guidance and supports available to schools relating to:
Supporting and promoting good hand hygiene;
Enhanced cleaning regimes within our schools;
Maintaining physical distancing within schools and in the classroom; and
The use of face coverings/masks in schools.
Supporting and Promoting Good Hand Hygiene
Section 5.1 of the Public Health Advice stresses the importance of regular and good hand hygiene as a key control measure to minimise the risk of spread of COVID19 in infection is introduced.
The Public Health Advice provides practical guidance on:
Frequency of hand hygiene;
Measures to support and promote good hand hygiene;
Guidance on hand washing facilities, hand washing products and hand sanitiser.
Schools should carefully consider how best to apply this section of the Public Health Advice on hand hygiene in their school.
In support of this work, schools will be provided by the Department with:
access to training on when to wash hands and how to wash them properly.
posters for display throughout the school to promote good hand hygiene; and
access to hand hygiene products and consumables through a centralised drawdown framework (as described later in this Roadmap).
In addition, in primary schools a focus will be placed on the use of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme as a way to promote personal hygiene including proper hand hygiene for younger pupils.
As noted in the Public Health Advice “Hand hygiene can be achieved by hand washing or use of a sanitiser (when hands look clean)”.
As existing handwashing facilities in schools were not designed for the enhanced level of handwashing envisaged necessary in a post COVID19 environment without significantly impacting on educational class time, funding will be provided to augment hand hygiene facilities in schools.
Given that hand sanitisers can be deployed more readily at entry and exit points of schools and for classrooms, the Department will provide funding to schools to install and use hand sanitisers for each classroom and other key locations (entry/exit points) in their school.
Schools will have access to hand sanitiser dispensers, and the ongoing supply of sanitiser for each school through a centralised drawdown framework.
The framework will be available for drawdown from early August and detailed guidance will issue to schools on how to use it.
The above measures will be important elements in ensuring that best practice in hand hygiene is applied in schools.
Enhanced Cleaning Regimes in our Schools
In line with the Public Health Advice, more regular and enhanced cleaning regimes will need to be implemented in each school to manage the risk of introduction and spread of COVID19.
Section 5.5 and 5.6 of the Public Health Advice provides relevant guidance to schools on effective school cleaning including:
steps to be taken before reopening the school;
how to clean;
the options for both routine and post COVID19 case cleaning for surfaces, toilets and equipment;
guidance on cleaning of shared equipment in schools such as musical instruments, art materials, electronic and sports equipment.
guidance on how to manage cleaning of toys for young children and for the care of equipment and aids for pupils with special educational needs;
the PPE to be used for cleaning in schools as well as the waste management treatment of materials resulting from routine cleaning and post COVID19 cases.
that each setting in a school should be cleaned at least once per day and where there is access to additional cleaning support during school hours it should be focused on frequently touched objects and surfaces; and
the cleaning steps that should take place in a school room where an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID19 was present as well as the arrangements needed for communal areas the person may have visited/used.
In support of schools implementing this enhanced cleaning regime in line with the Public Health Advice and the COVID19 Response Plan, schools will be provided with:
A template checklist within the COVIDResponse Plan related to cleaning;
A module in the Induction Training Programme which focuses on cleaning; and
A COVID19 capitation grant to fund the cost of enhanced cleaning regimes within schools.
Maintaining Physical Distancing in Schools
The Public Health Advice sets out the
“..the principle of distancing can be usefully applied in the school setting, allowing for some flexibility when needed whilst noting that it must be applied in a practical way, recognising that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue”.
In terms of maintaining physical distancing, measures outlined in the Public Health Advice fall into two broad categories:
Increasing separation;
Decreasing interaction between students themselves, between students and staff and between staff when they are together;
the implementation of physical distancing will look different across the various ages and stages of learning;
care should be taken to avoid generating tension or potential conflict and some flexibility in the implementation of measures may be required at times; and
staff will not always be able to maintain physical distance from their students and it is not appropriate that they would be expected to do so where this could have a detrimental impact on the student or the learning and health and safety of other students.
Given that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school; and (iv) student numbers
schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfigurations / operational changes necessary to maintain physical distancing.
Section 5.3 of the Public Health Advice outlines the practical measures that should be considered and, if appropriate, implemented in schools at both primary and post primary level.
The implementation of physical reconfiguration measures in schools, allied to the additional supports set out later in this Roadmap, provide the operational means through which physical distancing within schools can be maintained.
Specific additional guidance on the matter on maintaining physical distancing within the classroom at both primary and post primary level is set out below.
Maintaining physical distance in the classroom Primary
The Public Health Advice sets out the guidelines for maintaining physical distance in the classroom as primary level:
A distance of 1 metre should be maintained between desks or between individual pupils.
It is recognised that younger children are unlikely to maintain physical distancing indoors.
Therefore, achieving this recommendation in the first 4 years of primary school, is not a prerequisite to reopening a primary school for all pupils.
Where possible, workstations should be allocated consistently to the same staff and children rather than having spaces that are shared.
The risk of spread of infection may be reduced by structuring pupils and their teachers into Class Bubbles (i.e.
a class grouping which stays apart from other classes as much as possible) and discrete groups or ‘Pods’ within those class bubbles, to the extent that this is practical.
If a class is divided into Pods, there should be at least 1m distance between individual Pods within the Class Bubble and between individuals in the pod, whenever possible.
Generally speaking the objective is to limit contact and sharing of common facilities between people in different Class Bubbles (and Pods within those Class Bubbles) as much as possible, rather than to avoid all contact between Pods, as the latter will not always be possible.
The aim of the system within the school, is that each class grouping mix only with their own class from arrival at school in the morning until departure at the end of the school day.
The Pods within those Class Bubbles is an additional measure, to limit the extent of close contact within the Class Bubble.
Pod sizes should be kept as small as is likely to be reasonably practical in the specific classroom context.
To the greatest extent possible, pupils and teaching staff should consistently be in the same Class Bubbles although this will not be possible at all times.
Different Class Bubbles should where possible have separate breaks and meal times or separate areas at break or meal times [or this could be different class years i.e.
Sharing educational material between Pods should be avoided/minimised where possible.
Staff members who move from class bubble to class bubble should be limited as much as possible
To maintain physical distancing in the classroom, primary schools and special schools should:
Reconfigure class spaces to maximise physical distancing
Utilise and reconfigure all available space in the school in order to maximise physical distancing
To support primary schools and special schools in the implementation of physical distancing in the classroom, the Department has developed a suite of illustrative classroom layouts of potential options (including arrangements for special classes) which are in accordance with the public health advice, and assumes
Room is clear of any unnecessary furniture/shelves etc. on the walls
A variety of classroom sizes.
A link to the suite of illustrative primary classroom layouts is available here.
Funding will be provided under the enhanced minor works grant to facilitate this classroom reconfiguration works.
This funding will be provided to schools by mid August.
Maintaining physical distance in the classroom Post Primary
In implementing the public health advice within post primary school classrooms, it is acknowledged that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school; (iv) student numbers; (v) class configuration; and (vi) ease of potential access to space outside the school.
In recognition that a ‘one size fits all’ approach would not be appropriate as schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate configuration for their school, the Department has developed a Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020/21 School Year.
The Framework sets out a suite of available measures that must be implemented at individual school level to the greatest possible extent.
The suite of measures set out in the Framework are:
Reconfigure class spaces to maximise physical distancing;
Utilising and reconfiguring all available space in the school in order to maximise physical distancing;
Reconfiguring Classes;
Consider Use of Live Streaming within the School; and
Accessing available spaces within the local community
These suite of measures provides a practical framework for schools to use to maintain physical distancing in the classroom with the full return of all students for the 2020/21 school year.
In exceptional circumstances, where notwithstanding the application of these measures, physical distancing by organisational means for a larger class proves not to be possible, then the school must consider the use of face covering/visors in that larger class.
This exceptional measure should be kept continually under review by the school, who should continue to make every effort to devise an alternative solution using the measures set out at 1 to 6 above.
Staff or students who cannot wear face coverings or visors for health reasons should be based in other classrooms or areas wherever possible.
Students should not be required to wear face coverings or visors for the duration of the whole school day.
A link to the Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020/21 School Year can be found here.
Use of Face Coverings/Masks within Schools
On the use of face coverings/masks in schools, the Public Health Advice states that:
“Nonmedical masks may reduce transmission from individuals who are shedding the virus.
However, the extent of this benefit is unknown (especially in children) and would only be potentially beneficial if done properly.
It is not practical for many students to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day.
Cloth face coverings are not suitable for children under the age of 13 and anyone who:
has trouble breathing
is unconscious or incapacitated
is unable to remove it without help
has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the face covering
Older students should not be requested to wear a facial covering but those who may wish to wear a facial covering where physical distancing is difficult to maintain should not be discouraged.
It is essential that those wearing a cloth face covering understand
The purpose is not to protect themselves but to reduce onward transmission and the benefit is reliant on ensuring the mask is worn appropriately see guidance on mask wearing
Wearing a face covering or mask does not negate the need to stay at home if symptomatic.
It is not a teachers responsibility to enforce mask use by pupils
In line with the Public Health Advice, the use of face coverings/masks by pupils in primary schools by pupils should not occur.
In post primary schools, the use of face coverings/masks by students may be a feature where:
The student themselves wishes to wear a facial covering in circumstances where physical distancing is difficult to maintain within the school; and/or
In the exceptional circumstances, where notwithstanding the application of the measures in the Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020/21 School Year, physical distancing by organisational means for a larger class proves not to be possible.
Additional Supports Available to Schools
The Department is providing capital and current funding now of an additional €377 million to support the safe and sustainable reopening of schools under the Roadmap.
Further funding for school costs related to hand hygiene measures and PPE needs under the COVID19 Response Plan, will be confirmed post the establishment of the drawdown framework of suppliers, which schools will have access to, described at the end of this section.
In providing these additional supports, the Department is conscious that schools need to have certainty that what is provided not only allows them to reopen safely but to remain open.
The Department recognises that given the size and scale of the schools system and the inherent differences between primary, and post primary schools and the particular challenges for special schools and special classes, that a “one size fits all” approach would not be appropriate and schools should be provided with some flexibility to manage the suite of resources now available from the Department.
The section sets out the additional supports and measures available to primary, post primary and special schools/special classes.
The range of additional supports available to Primary Schools are:
An enhanced Minor Works Grant to support full implementation of COVID19 response plans;
Employing an aide to help with the school reopening logistics;
Increased management support to schools;
Extending the current pilot supply panel for substitute teachers on a nationwide basis; and
Additional financial supports to provide for additional cleaning, hand hygiene and PPE costs under the COVID19 Response Plans.
Enhanced Minor Works to Support Full Implementation of COVID19 Response Plans
The full implementation of the COVID19 Response Plans for Schools, and the Public Health Advice, may require some reconfiguration works within schools including:
Ensuring that all available space in the school should be availed of in order to safely maximising physical distancing; and
the class space should be reconfigured to maximise physical distancing
Given that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school and (iv) student numbers; individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration works for their school.
To support this work, a once off enhanced minor works grant will paid to all primary schools by midAugust.
By providing funding to schools in this way, schools will have the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly in compliance with the Public Health Advice and this Roadmap.
The Minor Works Grant is based on a flat rate of €5,500 plus a per capita rate of €18.50 for each pupil (€74 in the case of pupils in special schools or special classes).
The enhanced element of the minor work grant will match this (therefore doubling the minor works grant to schools).
The table below provides an illustrative example of the value of the minor works grant for primary schools of various sizes.
Current Minor Works Grant

Employing an aide to help with school reopening logistics
Funding will be provided to primary schools to employ an aide to assist with the physical and logistical arrangements necessary for school reopening including movement of furniture, setting up hand sanitising stations, signage, training, engaging with parents and Funding will be provided to each primary school on a sliding scale to facilitate this work.
The level of funding is based on the size of the schools and is set out in the following table:
Increased Management Supports to Schools
The Department is providing funding for 1 release day per week for teaching principals and for those primary schools with an admin principal, there will also be release days for the deputy principal.

Additional Financial supports to schools to cover additional cleaning, hand hygiene and PPE costs
To support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in schools, a COVID19 capitation payment will be used as the mechanism to support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in Primary schools, including special schools and special classes, with close to an additional €40 million for this purpose.
This will be provided on a sliding scale in line with pupil enrolments.
Enhanced support will be provided for special schools and classes.
Examples of the amount payable to schools of various sizes is provided in the table below.
Primary schools supplemental COVID19 Grant for cleaning costs
The COVID19 capitation grant will also be the mechanism through which additional funding will be provided to cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures and PPE requirements under the COVID19 Response Plan.
Additional provision for this purpose will be confirmed with the establishment of the drawdown framework of suppliers described later in this section.
Additional Support for Post Primary Schools
The range of additional supports available to post primary schools are:
A new Minor Works Grant to post primary schools to support full implementation of COVID19 response plans;
Employing an aide to help with the school reopening logistics;
1,080 additional teaching posts including 120 guidance posts;
Enhanced supervision supports; and
Additional financial supports to schools to cover additional cleaning, hand hygiene and PPE costs under COVID19 Response Plans.
A new Minor Works Grant to Post Primary School to Support Full Implementation of COVID19 Response Plans
The full implementation of the COVID19 Response Plans for Schools, and the Public Health Advice, may require some reconfiguration works within schools including: Ensuring that all available space in the school should be availed of in order to safely maximising physical distancing; and
the class space should be reconfigured to maximise physical distancing
Given that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school and (iv) student numbers; individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration works for their school.
To support this work, a new once off minor works grant will paid to all eligible post primary schools by midAugust.
By providing funding to schools in this way, schools will have necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly in compliance with the Public Health Advice and this Roadmap.
The Minor Works grant is based on a flat rate of €10,000 per school plus a per capita rate of €100 for each student (€400 in the case of students in special classes).
The table below provides an illustrative example of the value of the minor works grant for post primary schools of various sizes.
Employing an aide to help with school reopening logistics
Funding will be provided to post primary schools to employ an aide, similar to an examination aide, to assist with the physical and logistical arrangements necessary for school reopening including movement of furniture, setting up hand sanitising stations, signage, training, engaging with parents and staff etc.
Funding will be provided to each post primary school on a sliding scale to facilitate this work.
The level of funding is based on the size of the schools and is set out in the following table:
1,000 Additional Teaching Posts
The Department is making over 1,000 additional teaching posts available to post primary schools in the free scheme.
Posts equivalent to 0.6 PTR reduction will be allocated based as normal on school enrolments and will be clearly identifiable in the school’s staffing schedule.
This allocation will support the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary.
These posts will also provide for management supports.
Approximately 120 posts will also be provided for guidance to support student wellbeing recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid19 pandemic challenges.
These posts will bring guidance provision in schools back to the level last seen before the financial crises.
Schools will have flexibility to consider how best to align this resource allocation within the objectives of the School’s Guidance Plan.
It is also recognised that at an individual school level, notwithstanding the range of measures including the framework to support physical distancing and the teaching and management allocation referenced here, that some challenges may remain to allow a post primary school to fully reopen safely.
The Department is making available a number of posts to support these schools and relevant details will be included in circular letters to schools.
Enhanced Supervision Supports
€40m funding is being provided for additional supervision to support the management of physical distancing in post primary schools (such as ensuring the careful movement of students to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom).
An additional funding allocation will be provided to schools to support this work and will be on a sliding scale to reflect pupil enrolments.
Examples of the amount payable to schools of various sizes is provided in the table below.
Post Primary Schools Supplemental COVID19 Grant for Substitution & Supervision
Additional Financial supports to schools to cover additional cleaning, hand hygiene and PPE costs
€12.4m will be provided to schools for enhanced cleaning to reduce the risk of spread of COVID19 in schools.
The COVID19 capitation payment will be used as the mechanism to support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in schools with an additional €12.4m will be provided to schools for this purpose.
This will be provided on a sliding scale in line with pupil enrolments and specific additional supports will be provided for special schools and classes.
Examples of the amount payable to schools of various sizes is provided in the table below.
Post Primary schools supplemental Covid Grant for cleaning costs
The COVID19 capitation grant will also be the mechanism through which additional funding will be provided to cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures and PPE requirements under the COVID19 Response Plan.
Additional provision for this purpose will be confirmed to schools with the establishment of the drawdown framework of suppliers described later in this section.
Additional Support to Special Schools and for Special Classes
The Department is making additional provision for special schools and special classes in recognition of the particular challenges that these schools and classes will face dealing with children with complex medical and care needs.
Additional NEPS psychologists will be appointed to provide enhanced services to support the wellbeing of our school communities at this time, with a particular emphasis on the wellbeing of our special school communities.
Special schools will receive funding equivalent to 10 days, for the purposes of employing an aide to assist with the logistics for preparing for reopening.
To support this work, a once off enhanced minor works grant will paid to all schools by midAugust.
By providing funding to schools in this way, schools will have necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly in compliance with the Public Health Advice and this Roadmap.
Enhanced per capita rates apply for pupils attending a special school or attending a special class attached to a mainstream school Special schools.
Those schools with admin Deputy Principals will be provided with 16 release days.
The Department is also supporting the replacement of all absences of SNAs in school settings.
Enhanced COVID19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms with a small number of students, operating specialist provision.
Primary Schools Supplemental Covid19 Grant funding for cleaning costs in Special Schools
The COVID19 capitation grant will also be the mechanism through which additional funding will be provided to cater for costs related to hand hygiene measures and PPE requirements under the COVID19 Response Plan.
Additional provision for this purpose will be confirmed with the establishment of the drawdown framework of suppliers described later in this section.
Access to Procurement Framework & Funding to support Hand Hygiene & PPE Needs within Schools
To ensure access for schools, on a value for money basis, to a secure supply chain for any Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Consumables and Equipment associated with COVID19 Response Plans, the Department is in the final stages of establishing a drawdown framework of suppliers of such products.
It is expected that this multisupplier arrangement will be available to schools to access from early August.
Under the drawdown framework, schools will be able to choose a supplier from the framework and the products which best suit their needs.
It is intended that order from schools will be processed within a very short timeline and delivered directly to schools.
Accompanying guidelines to schools on the accessing the framework will issue in early August.
All PPE, consumables and equipment requirements of schools under this Roadmap and with schools COVID19 Response Plans, and in line with the Public Health Advice, will be available through the Framework.
Hand sanitiser dispensers;
Hand sanitiser liquid;
Hand soap;
Disposable Paper Towels;
Wipes;
Gloves;
Face masks
Face coverings/visors;
Aprons; and
Detergents etc.
The funding to cover school costs will be by way of a COVID19 capitation grant will be issued to schools and will be confirmed with the establishment of the drawdown framework.
Arrangements to Get Children Safely to our Schools
Getting children to school safely has been a key part of planning for reopening schools.
In urban areas, this will mean supporting the NTA in promoting various alternative means for children to get to school in a safe way, including walking and cycling and more generally in reducing the impact on the public transport system of school reopening.
There is intensive engagement with Bus Éireann to carefully plan for the School Transport Scheme and SEN transport, to ensure it is operating within the parameters of public health advice.
School Transport Scheme Services
School Transport Scheme services operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department will fully operate as normal, in line with public health advice, when schools reopen for the 2020/2021 school year.
In planning for normal resumption of school transport services consideration has been taken of the fact that school transport somewhat differs to public transport in that:
School transport services are controlled environments.
Each transport service carries the same children on a daily basis to their school of attendance.
It is a restricted group of transport users which will facilitate contact tracing if required.
Observing hygiene requirements will be a key priority and clear communication to all parents of children or to older students using school transport services will set out the following requirements for those travelling on school transport:
Not to use school transport if they are displaying symptoms.
To maintain physical distancing while waiting for transport.
To always sit in preassigned seating and next to a sibling or child from their class group (this should be the same child at all times).
To use hand sanitizer on boarding the bus.
To observe respiratory etiquette at all times while waiting for and onboard transport services.
To disembark the bus one by one in an orderly fashion; and
With the exception of those children who for medical or special educational needs reasons are not in a position to wear a facemask or face covering, all other students travelling on the postprimary scheme are required to wear facemasks while waiting for and onboard transport services.
With regard to SEN Transport services, these health guidelines will also apply.
Funding supports will be made available to schools for the provision of masks or visors to School Bus Escorts where required, bearing in mind the SEN needs of the child/children on the service, and where physical distancing cannot be maintained.
These will be accessible to schools through the drawdown framework described earlier.
Bus Éireann, in consultation with the Department, is providing information and guidance for their own employees and to contractors contracted to operate on the School Transport Scheme to advise them of:
Sanitisation and additional cleaning requirements.
Use of Personal Protective Equipment for school transport staff.
Measures to take if a child on a service becomes ill or is displaying symptoms while travelling.
Return to work safely protocols.
Supporting the Wellbeing of School Communities
The wellbeing of our school communities is a fundamental element of the Department’s overall plan to ensure a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid19 pandemic.
We are living through exceptional times and this impacts on the wellbeing of everyone in different ways and at different times.
People have been naturally worried about the risk to their physical health and that of their loved ones and have been challenged by the public health measures that were put in place in Ireland to control the spread of the virus, such as staying at home and school closures.
People have an inbuilt capacity to adapt.
This is what is at the heart of resilience.
Most people are weathering this storm and will emerge stronger and with new skills.
Most respond really well to information and practical advice on new ways of managing and staying active and connected.
Some will, for a variety of reasons, struggle a little to adapt and will need greater levels of practical and social support to make the adjustments needed to stay well.
A very small number may find the changes brought about by COVID19 very challenging, and may need higher levels of practical and mental health supports.
We are now preparing for the reopening of schools.
We know that most students, and indeed their families and school staff will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work.
This will be a time of change, with new rules and routines to learn, in order to keep everyone safe.
Some students may feel worried about returning to school, and that’s normal.
Most will however, reengage with little difficulty after an initial settling in period.
Supporting Wellbeing: Essential Elements
The Department has developed and prepared a comprehensive response to supporting the wellbeing of school communities at this time guided by five essential principles for wellbeing promotion at times like this.
A sense of safety
A sense of calm
A sense of belonging and connectedness to school
A sense of selfefficacy and schoolcommunity efficacy
A sense of hope
These principles are widely accepted and explicitly recommended as protective factors to support optimal returning to normalcy and wellbeing in the aftermath of emergency situations.
A tiered model of support is recommended with a strong universal focus, based on the knowledge that people are naturally resilient and most will adapt with the provision of basic practical and empathetic supports while acknowledging some groups will need additional and more intensive levels of support.
In this regard the Departments of Health; and Children, Disability, Equality and Integration; along with their services, will play a key partnership role.
Support provided by the Department of Education will utilise the usual school support structure – the Continuum of Support (Figure 1).
This support structure allows schools to provide universal support for all students, using prevention and early intervention approaches, to support wellbeing and transition back to school.
The Continuum of Support framework also recognises that some students who continue to struggle to settle, despite the provision of universal supports, will require more targeted support, while still others with more complex need will require an individualised approach to support.
The foundation for the provision of a continuum of support in schools, will be the provision of support for school staff wellbeing, and guidance to help them feel confident and equipped to support the wellbeing of their students.
The Department has worked closely with its broad range of support services and agencies2, and with the HSE/HSEfunded services and the Tusla Education Support Service to create an aligned and coherent package of supports and resources to assist schools in this regard.
Supports will include:
A comprehensive communications campaign, delivering universal messages of safety and wellbeing to all
Webpage with access to all information relating to the reopening of schools, including information about wellbeing, with links to specific resources, guidance and support
Wellbeing Webinars for primary/special/postprimary schools supporting wellbeing as schools reopen
Wellbeing Toolkit for Teachers with a range of easily downloadable, userfriendly materials
Services provided by the National Educational Psychological Service, with enhanced focus on special school communities
Consultation and Advice Service to schools
Casework Service in schools
Support and Development Service to schools Professional Learning Opportunities for Teachers
Access to a range of support/resources and professional learning opportunities provided by:
Department’s Teacher Education Support Services
National Council for Special Education Support Service (NCSE) o National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA)
National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE)
Tusla Education Support Service (TESS)
Access to additional teaching posts at post primary level, which may be leveraged to support guidance, wellbeing and leadership support
emental health services, including online counselling, provided by the HSE/HSE funded service providers including spunout.ie, Jigsaw, MyMind, Childline and Turn2Me.
The Department’s Support Services/Agencies include the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), Centre for School Leadership (CSL), National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT), National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) and National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).
Promoting School Staff Wellbeing:
The Department recognises the need for school staff wellbeing and collective self care.
Support for school staff wellbeing will be provided by Department Support Services including the PDST and CSL, as well as by the HSE’s Health Promotion Team.
An Occupational Health Strategy is in place as a supportive resource for staff in schools.
The aim of the Occupational Health Strategy is to promote the health and wellbeing of employees in the workplace, with a strong focus on prevention.
The Occupational Health Strategy comprises the Employee Assistance Service and the Occupational Health Service.
The Employee Assistance Service (EAS) is provided by Spectrum.Life under the logo of ‘Wellbeing Together: Folláinne Le Chéile’.
Under the EAS, employees have a dedicated freephone confidential helpline 1800 411 057 available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year providing advice on a range of issues such as wellbeing, legal, financial, mediation, management support etc.
Where required, short term counselling is available to employees and their families (over the age of 18 years and living at home).
A bespoke wellbeing portal and app which offers access to podcasts and blogs on topics around wellbeing and mental health, family life, exercise and nutrition is also available.
In addition online cognitive behavioural therapy is provided.
As part of the services provided by Spectrum Life a Mental Health Promotion Manager is available to develop and deliver evidence based mental health and wellbeing initiatives to reduce stigma and improve mental health literacy and to increase engagement with the service.
They will also be providing a series of webinars and presentations to promote staff wellbeing in schools as schools reopen and during the upcoming school year.
Guidance on Learning and School Programmes in 2020/21
The Department has worked closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the Professional Development Services for Teachers (PDST) on supporting schools in mediating the curriculum for the new school year.
Curriculum Guidance – General Principles
The Department recognises that curriculum considerations for 2020/21 school year at both primary/special school and postprimary level must take account of the variable learning experiences of pupils/students during the period of school closure, the likely gaps in learning and the practical context in which teaching and learning will be taking place in the new school year.
Provision for curriculum also needs to take account of the likelihood that the impact of school closures on pupil/student experiences has not been uniform.
It is likely that pupils with special educational needs, pupils at risk of educational disadvantage, pupils with English as an additional language and pupils experiencing homelessness or living in direct provision have been the most adversely affected by the lack of classroom contact time.
The Department has prepared a series of guidance documents for schools – for primary schools, postprimary schools, schools providing Transition Year and schools and centres for education offering the Leaving Certificate Applied programme in 2020/21.
The purpose of the guidance documents is to ensure that pupils/students can settle back into school, that all of the school community can stay safe and well and pupils/students can pick up and progress their learning, experiencing as full and enjoyable a curriculum as possible.
The principles underpinning the guidance documents are:
Adherence to the relevant health and safety requirements;
Supporting the wellbeing of learners and school staff;
Ensuring equity and consistency in curriculum provision and pupil/student learning experiences;
Supporting pupils/students where they are at in their learning and providing them with what they need in order to flourish and be successful;
Establishing curriculum and instructional priorities and planning accordingly;
Developing and supporting collaboration with parents and agencies, in order to maximise outcomes for pupils/students in a fair and equitable way;
At post primary level there are additional principles to recognise the autonomy of schools to determine how the curriculum is planned and mediated; and
An approach to planning that is learner centred, balanced, adaptive and responsive to pupil/ student needs.
Primary Level
As most primary pupils will not have been in their school building for a period of over five months, the focus at the start of the school year will be on managing the transition period of returning to school from home.
While the return to school offers a welcome opportunity for children to revive social connections it is also recognised that it will be an anxious time for some.
Schools will be encouraged to allow time for pupils to develop the relationships necessary so that they are available and ready to participate in a meaningful way with their learning.
There is a focus in the documentation on welcoming junior infants to schools and a wide range of resources and support materials have been provided by the Department of Education as well as the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to support this group.
The guidance outlines the learning approaches which schools should take and the need to allow for revisiting and revising of areas of the curriculum to reinforce and consolidate learning.
Schools will also be required to reprioritise certain areas of the curriculum, especially during the initial weeks of the first term, to give greater time and attention to areas such as Social, Personal and Health Education, Physical Education, Language and Mathematics.
It is intended that as schools form comprehensive pictures of where pupils are in their learning they will work towards a more typical curriculum plans.
Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN)
It is recognised that pupils with SEN will require particular support at the time of transition back to school including supporting their wellbeing, reducing potential anxiety and planning learning experiences that take account of the effect of school closures on their progress.
Approximately 15,000 pupils with SEN will have availed of the Department supported summer provision and all records of progress for these children, whether the programmes were delivered in school or home settings will be available to their schools to support planning for their needs in the new term.
The guidance provides additional strategies to support children with ASD where it is likely that the impact of school closures will have been significant so that learning experiences, routines and sensory needs should be carefully planned.
PostPrimary Level
In the guidance at postprimary level, the Department recognises that welcoming first years and supporting their transition is a critical task for schools.
The Education Passport for these students should have been received from their primary school to assist in planning for their educational needs.
Prioritising curriculum in the key skills at Junior Cycle such as managing myself, managing information and thinking and staying well is proposed to support these students.
Maintaining the same and subject teachers and tutor groups where possible may be considered by schools as an effective way to support other post primary student group transitions.
Schools are asked in particular to be flexible in their procedures around facilitating subject selections at fifth year.
The importance of student wellbeing in the return to school is recognised and schools are required to consider these matters in a “whole of school” and “whole of staff” approach.
Notwithstanding the focus on wellbeing, the Department is aware that some schools are experiencing challenges in increasing the provision for wellbeing from 300 hours to 400 hours at Junior Cycle, so schools can defer the increased provision until the 2021/22 school year.
Assessment for certification
There is significant autonomy in schools in deciding how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools and therefore the Department does not propose to centrally prescribe adjustments of the curriculum.
It is considered that the most appropriate way to reflect the challenges that have occurred for students in 2019/20 and potentially in 2020/21 is to incorporate adjustments into the certificate examinations in 2021.
Junior Cycle
The number of classroom based assessments to be completed by those entering third year has been reduced and the dates for completion of some elements extended into the new school year.
Detailed arrangements in relation to the Junior Cycle certification examinations in 2021 will be made available before the start of the school year.
The Department recognises that some changes will be required to the assessment arrangements for the Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Applied and Leaving Certificate Vocational Programmes.
A key consideration in making these adjustments is the need to maintain familiarity with the structure of the questions and assessment components for students and teachers.
There will be no need to issue sample papers to reflect the changes.
The changes will be broadly proportionate but may vary, taking into account specific context across modules, subjects and programmes.
In all cases they will involve some combination of:
Students will be provided with greater choice in written examinations; this will be supported through the provision of additional questions and/or adjustments to mandatory sections on written examination papers
The dates on which coursework briefs are issued will be brought forward to allow for additional preparation time for students and teachers
In some subjects, adjustments to the requirements for practical examinations will be made; these adjustments will reflect the need to manage access to equipment to complete the preparatory aspects.
Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA)
The Department’s guidance document sets out the curriculum and assessment arrangements for the LCA Year 1 and Year 2 students for the school year 2020/21.
In the case of LCA Year 2 students it outlines the revised arrangement for the satisfactory completion of modules, student tasks, and final examinations.
Transition Year (TY)
The Department, through this guidance information sets out how much of what is valued in the TY programme can continue to be a central feature in the 2020/21 school year.
The programme is ideally placed to build on progress at junior cycle, allowing additional time as needed to identify priority areas for knowledge and skill development in senior cycle.
It is also ideally suited to the use of digital technology and the guidance identifies ways that experiences in TY can be enhanced through practical planning tips.
It also reminds schools to minimise the costs associated with this programme in the current environment.
Taking account of the loss of inclass time at the end of the 2019/2020 school year, the potential challenges facing schools at the outset of the new school year, and the workload of principals at this time, it is acknowledged that this is not a suitable time for significant curriculum change, particularly at the start of the new school year.
In order to support schools in the practicalities of reengaging with students, a number of key decisions have been taken to pause elements of curriculum change that were due to commence in September 2020.
At primary level the consultation period on the the new primary curriculum framework is being extended to at least end year with completion expected by end Q2 2021.
The effect of this will push out the timeframe for the Primary Mathematics Curriculum and the curricula for each of the other subject areas.
Support for the Primary Languages Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile will restart in early 2021.
The NCCA will continue to undertake development work in the area of relationships and sexuality education (RSE) and traveller history and culture; and the Department will continue to undertake development work in relation to the Education for Sustainable Development strategy, the Literacy and Numeracy strategy and the STEM education implementation plan.
At post primary level this pause includes the following:
Junior Cycle – Schools were originally required to increase the number of hours of Wellbeing provision at Junior Cycle from 300 to 400 hours from September 2020.
They will now be able to defer this until September 2021.
Senior Cycle – A number of schools were due to introduce new optional subjects from September 2020, including Leaving Certificate Computer Science, Physical Education, and the Leaving Certificate Foreign Languages of Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese.
These schools will now be provided with the option to defer implementation until September 2021.
Implementation in schools of the revised specification for Leaving Certificate Art will be deferred by one year to September 2021.
The implementation of a number of new Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) Module Descriptors will be deferred by one year to September 2021.
Also at Senior Cycle planned consultation on new specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish is being deferred from the second half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.
Consultation on a number of other Leaving Certificate subjects will also be deferred, including Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Arabic, and Latin and Ancient Greek.
Work on the NCCA’s review of Senior Cycle has continued throughout 2020 and it is envisaged that Council’s Advisory Report to the Department will be finalised around the end of the year.
The Department will continue to work with schools to enable them to be agile and responsive in ensuring that pupils/ students can continue to experience the curriculum as fully as possible and to progress in their learning in an online environment in the event of an individual school closure or localised closure of schools.
Additional guidance and online materials for schools in this regard will be issued before the start of the new term.
Provision for Very High Risk Staff and Students and arrangements in the event of school closure in the future
While the Roadmap provides for the reopening of all schools to all students, each school must be ready to:
provide for pupils who cannot attend for health reasons related to COVID19, or a situation where a school may be faced with closure (in whole or part) for a period during which the curriculum will need to be delivered remotely.
The will necessitate an alternative provision approach in both circumstances, with relevant guidance set out below.
Schools will also be provided with resources to replace staff who have been assessed as unable to return to the workplace due to Covid19.
These staff will be facilitated to work from home in line with arrangements that are consistent with the approach of the civil and public service more widely.
This may include supporting very high risk students who cannot attend school.
Supporting pupils at “very high risk” of COVID19
The Department is conscious that there may be some pupils for whom return to school at the end of August may not be appropriate because the relevant public health guidelines indicate they are at “very high risk”.
Responsibility to ensure that these pupils receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with each school.
Good communication is key to supporting these pupils and to ensure their ongoing connection with their classmates and school community.
Additional supports will be provided for these pupils/students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school.
Schools will have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils/students, including pupils/students at ‘very high risk’ to COVID19.
Under the direction of the School Principal the designated teacher should:
Liaise with the class teacher and special education teacher on relevant curricular content and classwork;
Access relevant learning resources;
Provide the pupil/student with individualised support for his/her learning;
Increase the pupil/student autonomy, motivation, agency and wellbeing;
Improve the pupil/student capacity to be become a selfdirected learner;
Support the development of the pupil/student digital competency;
Avail of the communication/learning platform used by the school to ensure ongoing contact with classmates and class teacher.
Supporting Teaching and Learning in the home where there is localised school closure
During the period of school closures the Department provided schools in the primary and special school sector and at postprimary level with a series of “Continuity of Schooling Guidance” documents to help education professionals and parents to support children learning in a remote environment.
The events surrounding COVID19 and the public health restrictions which resulted in the emergency closure of schools to learners has highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in how they can provide for continuity of teaching and learning in the future.
The continuity of teaching and learning during the emergency period was achieved with significant additional effort from all school staff working remotely to ensure students were supported during this time.
Most schools put in place arrangements to communicate with students and parents demonstrating innovation and resilience by providing flexible local responses.
As a contingency for any such reoccurrence of closures whether localised or at a bigger scale to ensure compliance with any public health restrictions, it is vital that schools are prepared.
The Department is updating its Continuity of Schooling Guidance documents to support schools in responding in an agile way in the event of localised school closure.
Specifically schools will be provided with guidance and support to put in place arrangements to facilitate communication with and between staff, between staff and learners and to facilitate development of online approaches to remote and blended learning in the event that such is required.
In circumstances where there is clear public health advice from HSE Public Health that a school should close, schools will be supported to:
Make best use of guidance materials which were already provided to all schools during the period of school closures and will be further updated to reflect learning during the emergency period,
Alert parents/guardians to where pupils/students are at in terms of their learning,
Develop daily contact lesson activities to be carried out at home for primary pupils
Develop subject specific lessons at post primary level to be carried out at home by students,
Contact parents regularly to offer support and feedback,
Have a system in place to engage with pupils/students daily; and where possible to make arrangements to support students who do not have access to digital technology,
Make best use of digital technologies to allow continued engagement with pupils/students and their learning.
Ongoing Communication Arrangements
The communications for school reopening focuses on ensuring that schools, school communities and all stakeholders have clear, relevant and timely information to support the reopening process and continued operation of schools.
Continued Stakeholder Engagement;
Provision of Support Materials for Schools
Provision of Support Materials for students, parents and school communities; and Direct access to the Department for Schools during the Reopening process
Planning for school reopening has been undertaken in collaboration with stakeholders.
The process has included both meetings of the stakeholders together, and individual bilateral meetings with the department with specific groups on pertinent issues.
The Department would like to acknowledge the constructive and collaborative approach taken by the education partners and wider stakeholders, including other Government Departments and Agencies.
Stakeholders are fully engaged with the Department to develop the shape and design of solutions that are both workable and supported by sufficient and appropriately targeted resources.
A shared goal of all stakeholders is to provide certainty wherever possible, to communicate fully and in a timely fashion, and to have the wellbeing of the school community in mind in all communications.
The Department will continue to engage closely and intensively with education partners and other key stakeholders on the refinement of remaining elements of guidance related to the reopening and operation of schools, and the implementation of the measures set out in this Roadmap.
The Department is preparing and will disseminate a series of materials for schools to use in planning for reopening and in communicating with their communities in advance of schools reopening.
Induction training programmes for school staff produced by the Department – webinars on health and safety, returning to work safely, managing school return and wellbeing.
Tailored training is in development for different categories of school staff: teachers, lead worker representatives, SNAs, cleaners etc.
Guidance and support information on curriculum matters;
Distribution to schools of printed posters with ageappropriate key health messages: hand washing, sneeze and cough etiquette etc.
Provision to schools of digital versions of these for additional supply to be sourced locally if required.
Distribution to schools of the materials for their school communities.
Guidance for schools and ideas on communicating effectively on school re opening to their pupils and families.
Materials to support students, parents and school communities in returning safely
The Department is preparing and will disseminate a series of materials for schools to provide to their returning students and their families in advance of schools reopening.
These will include:
Short guidance for parents at both primary and postprimary level for children’s return to school, emphasising public health and wellbeing information
Ageappropriate communications material for students on returning to school, emphasising public health and wellbeing information.
Schools will be provided with material for distribution, and distribution will also be augmented by the Department using digital channels.
All materials will be produced with an emphasis on wellbeing, accessibility and inclusion.
Schools will be asked to disseminate schoolspecific information to their pupils’ families and provided with templates to do so.
Appropriate use will be made of media channels and gov.ie to ensure that the school community and their families have been reached with the important information that they need in returning to school.
The Department will implement a number of specific communication initiatives to directly support schools in the reopening process including:
A dedicated webpage to enable the sharing of information and updates in an open and transparent manner; and
A dedicated team within the Department to detail with specific queries of schools in relation to the Roadmap, available supports etc.
The dedicated team within the Department will provide a onestop shop for queries of school management on all elements of the implementation of the Roadmap as it pertains to their school.
What will schools be like when they reopen?
Schools will reopen for all students from the end of August.
While everyone wants schools to operate as normally as possible from August this year, it is recognised by all that it will be a different environment to how schools operated in March of this year.
Physical distancing, much less interaction between classes and class groups, staggered breaks and lunch times and a lot of flexibility within schools to maximise school spaces (including the use of PE Halls and GP Rooms as classrooms) will be a feature.
Recognising that there will a broad range of responses when the school community go back to school, ranging from children and their parents being happy and relieved to get back to school to some children being fearful and nervous, there will be specific emphasis on the wellbeing of the school community and our students and pupils as schools navigate through the reopening process.
Specific supports will be also be available for those children who struggle to come back to school, vulnerable groups and those children who may experience loss, grief and bereavement during the period of school closure.
A significant cultural shift in the behaviours of students, their families and staff is expected with each playing their roles in keeping the virus out of their school by ensuring
those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus stay out of school,
by maintaining best practice in terms of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in school, and
as well as by minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices.
As part of the school reopening process, extensive communication by the school with the school community on the specific arrangements that will apply in the school is expected to support their cultural shift.
Reopening our schools is not just a matter of achieving a certain minimum physical distancing.
It is also about getting students reengaged fully with learning, socialising with their peers, and for some preparing for examinations, for others transitioning to school life or a different level in terms of moving from primary to postprimary.
Students will need the support of their families, teachers and school staff in readjusting to school life and physical learning environments again.
School communities will rise to this challenge, and the key themes of the Public Health Advice necessary to keep us all safe will permeate throughout the school community, with everyone:
Applying common sense,
Adopting a balanced approach,
Doing everything practical to avoid the introduction of COVID19 into the school,
Being Aware of
o what we can all do to protect ourselves and each other,
o how to recognise and report the symptoms of COVID19, and o the need to stay at home if we feel unwell, and
Continuing to observe physical distancing, good hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette.

A revision of the COVID19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable operation of Post Primary Schools is necessary to ensure that it is in compliance with the Government’s Resilience and Recovery 20202021: Plan for Living with COVID19 and the ‘Work Safely Protocol’ which has been developed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Health with guidance documents provided by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA).
The ‘Work Safely Protocol’ is a revised version of the ‘Return to Work Safely Protocol’ and contains many of the elements and features of the original guidance but is updated to reflect the latest advice issued by Government and National Health Emergency Team (NPHET) to reduce the spread of COVID19 in the workplace.
Each workplace is required to have a COVID19 Response Plan.
In addition to being places of learning, schools are also places of work.
This document sets out the information that post primary schools need to review their school COVID19 Response Plan, including a COVID 19 policy, lead worker representative(s) and process to deal with a suspected case of COVID19.
The purpose of this document is to provide clear and helpful guidance for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID19 in post primary schools.
It provides key messages to minimise the risk of COVID19 for staff, students, families and the wider community while recognising the importance of education for the health and wellbeing of students and society as a whole.
This document focuses on the practical steps which can be taken in post primary schools to minimise the risk of the introduction of the infection into schools while recognising that no interpersonal activity is without risk of transmission of infection at any time.
The documentation and templates in this booklet are supported by the public health advice provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) for the safe reopening of schools and educational facilities.
Further advice from the HPSC on the use of face coverings in educational settings was received on the 6th August.
This advice is available here.
One of the key challenges is to balance the need for a practical and sensible level of caution with the need to provide a supportive environment for teaching and learning.
This document identifies the steps schools can take to do everything practical to avoid the introduction of COVID19 into the school and the steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the spread within the school itself.
The Department has worked intensively with the education partners to develop consistent plans, advice, protocols and guidance for schools, including the School COVID19 Response plan.
There is a suite of documentation available to support schools to continue to operate safely and fully including guidance on learning, school programmes and wellbeing for the 2020/21 school year.
There is also information on funding, staffing and resources to schools to support COVID19 measures.
Schools are advised to familiarise themselves with these documents.
All of the documents will be available at gov.ie/backtoschool
What is a COVID19 Response Plan?
A COVID19 Response Plan is designed to support the staff and Board of Management (BOM)/Education Training Board (ETB) in putting measures in place that aim to prevent the spread of COVID19 in the school environment
The COVID19 Response Plan details the policies and practices necessary for a school to meet the Government’s ‘Work Safely Protocol’, to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID19 in the school environment.
It is important that schoolbased teaching and learning and the operation of school facilities complies with the public health advice and guidance documents prepared by the Department.
Doing so minimises the risk to students, staff and others.
The response plan supports the sustainable operation of schools where the overriding objective is to protect the health of staff and students while promoting the educational and development needs of the students in the school.
The COVID19 response plan is a living document and will be updated in line with the public health advice as appropriate for post primary schools.
In line with the Work Safely Protocol, the key to maintaining a safe school requires strong communication and a shared collaborative approach between the BOM/ETB, staff, students and parents.
The assistance and cooperation of all staff, students, parents, contractors and visitors is critical to the success of the plan.
Every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the information provided in this document.
However, should errors or omissions be identified, please notify us so that appropriate measures can be taken to rectify same.
School COVID19 Policy
A COVID19 policy outlines the ongoing commitment of the school to implementing the plan and help prevent the introduction and spread of the virus.
The revised updated policy will be signed and dated by the chairperson and principal of the BOM/ETB and brought to the attention of the staff, students, parents and others.
A template of a School COVID19 policy can be found at Appendix 1.
Reviewing the safe operation of schools
The BOM/ETB aims to facilitate the continuation of school based teaching and learning and a safe working environment for staff.
The operation of schools must be done safely and in strict adherence to the public health advice and any guidance issued by the Department of Education.
Details for the safe operation of a school facility and the applicable controls are outlined in this document.
Each school will need to review their current processes to ensure that they include the following:
Arrangements to keep up to date with public health advice, changes to any Government plans for living with COVID19 and Department of Education updates;
Arrangements to pass on this information in a timely manner to staff, students, parents and others as required;
Ensured that staff have reviewed the training materials provided by the Department of Education (details at Section 4.1);
Provided staff with access to the Return to Work (RTW) form (details at Section 4.2);
Identified a Lead Worker representative(s) (details at Section 4.3);
Displayed posters and other signage to prevent introduction and spread of COVID19 (details at Section 4.4);
Made the necessary changes to the school or classroom layout if necessary to support the redesign of classrooms to support physical distancing (details at Section 4.5);
Removed unnecessary clutter to facilitate ongoing cleaning of the school taking into account the importance of having educational materials to create a stimulating learning environment;
Updated the health and safety risk assessment (details at Section 4.6);
Made necessary arrangements to limit access to the school to necessary visitors and maintain records of contacts to the school (details at 4.7);
Reviewed the school buildings to check the following after any period of closure:
Does the water system need flushing at outlets following low usage to prevent Legionella disease?
Has school equipment and mechanical ventilation been checked for signs of deterioration or damage before being used again?
Have bin collections and other essential services resumed?
There are checklists in place to assist schools on the details of what is needed for these arrangements in the Appendices of this plan.
Induction Training
All staff will undertake and complete COVID19 Induction Training prior to returning to the school building.
The aim of such training is to ensure that staff have full knowledge and understanding of the following:
Latest up todate advice and guidance on public health
COVID19 symptoms
What to do if a staff member or pupil develops symptoms of COVID19 while at school
Outline of the COVID19 response plan
Staff will be kept fully informed of the control measures in place in the school and their duties and responsibilities in preventing the spread of COVID19 and will be updated with any changes to the control measures or guidance available from the public health authorities.
If a staff member is unsure about any aspect of the COVID19 Response Plan, the associated control measures, or his/her duties, he/she should immediately seek guidance from the Principal who is supported in this role by the BOM/ETB.
Procedure for Returning to Work (RTW)
In order to return to the workplace, staff must complete a Return to Work (RTW) form.
It is available online or from the principal.
A RTW form should be completed and returned to the school before returning to work.
Schools should request staff to confirm that the details in the Return to Work Form remain unchanged following subsequent periods of closure such as school holidays.
The principal will also provide details of the Induction Training for completion by staff and details of any additional health and safety measures in place in the school to facilitate the staff member’s return to the school facility.
There are some school staff who may be unable to return to school.
Current public health guidelines have identified these people as being in groups who are defined as being at very high risk.
This will be updated in line with public health advice.
People at very high risk (extremely vulnerable):
The list of people in very high risk groups include people who:
are over 70 years of age – even if fit and well
have had an organ transplant
are undergoing active chemotherapy for cancer
are having radical radiotherapy for lung cancer
have cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
are having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer
are having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors
have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs
have severe respiratory conditions including cystic fibrosis, severe asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, lung fibrosis, interstitial lung disease and severe COPD
have a condition that means they have a very high risk of getting infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell)
are taking medicine that makes you much more likely to get infections (such as high doses of steroids or immunosuppression therapies)
have a serious heart condition and are pregnant
The advice for this group is available from the HSE.
Details of the working arrangements that apply to the very high risk school staff, is in accordance with those applying for the public service generally, and is detailed in the relevant Department of Education circulars available on the Department’s website.
The protocol provides for the appointment of a Lead Worker Representative (LWR) in each workplace.
The LWR will work in collaboration with the employer to assist in the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of COVID 19 and monitor adherence to those measures and to be involved in communicating the health advice around COVID19 in the workplace.
The process for appointment of the lead worker representative in schools has been agreed centrally between the Department of Education and the education partners.
Responsibility for the development, updating and implementation of the COVID19 Response Plan and the associated control measures lies primarily with the Board of Management/ Education and Training Board and school management.
Strong communication and a shared collaborative approach is key to protecting against the spread of COVID19 in schools, and looking after the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and students.
Adherence to the Work Safely Protocol will only be achieved if everyone has a shared responsibility in implementing the measures contained within the Protocol in their place of work.
If a staff member has any concerns or observations in relation to the COVID19 Response Plan, control measures or the adherence to such measures by staff, students or others he/she should contact the lead worker(s) who will engage with the principal/BOM.
In summary, the role of the LWR is to:
Represent all staff in the workplace regardless of role, and be aware of specific issues that may arise in respect of different staff cohorts;
Work collaboratively with school management to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of employees in relation to COVID19;
Keep up to date with the latest COVID19 public health advice;
In conjunction with school management, promote good hygiene practices such as washing hands regularly and maintaining good respiratory etiquette along with maintaining social distancing in accordance with public health advice;
Assist school management with implementing infection prevention control measures to suppress COVID19 in the workplace in line with the Work Safely Protocol and current public health advice;
In conjunction with school management, monitor adherence to measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID19;
Conduct regular reviews of safety measures;
Report any issues of concern immediately to school management and keep records of such issues and actions taken to rectify them;
Consult with the school management on the school’s COVID19 Response Plan in the event of someone developing COVID19 while in school including the location of an isolation area and a safe route to that area;
Following any incident, assess with the school management any follow up action that is required;
Consult with colleagues on matters relating to COVID19 in the workplace;
Make representations to school management on behalf of their colleagues on matters relating to COVID19 in the workplace.
All staff, students, parents, contractors and visitors have a responsibility both as individuals and collectively to have due regard for their own health and safety and that of others and to assist with the implementation of the COVID19 Response Plan and associated infection prevention control measures.
Full details of the arrangements which apply for the LWR in post primary schools is set out at Appendix 3.
Signage
Schools will be required to display signage outlining the signs and symptoms of COVID19 and to support good hand and respiratory hygiene.
The Department will provide printed posters to schools with age appropriate key health messages – hand washing, sneeze and cough etiquette etc.
Please see link below to these posters which will allow schools who may wish to have an additional supply of posters available.
Any such supply can be sourced locally.
Schools can then arrange to display the posters in prominent areas such as offices, corridors, staffroom area, classrooms and toilets.
Making Changes to School Layout
Maintaining physical distancing in the school environment is recommended as one of the key infection prevention control measures to minimize the risk of the introduction and spread of COVID19.
Further information on how physical distancing can be used in the school environment is found at Section 5.4 below including a link to the suite of illustrative post primary classroom layouts.
Schools should reconfigure classrooms and other areas as necessary to support physical distancing in line with the guidance in advance of school reopening.
Health and Safety Risk Assessment
COVID19 represents a hazard in the context of health and safety in the school environment.
A template risk assessment to identify the control measures required to mitigate the risk of COVID19 in school settings is attached at Appendix 4.
It is important that schools review their emergency procedures involving, fire safety, first aid, accidents and dangerous occurrences to consider any new risks that arise due to the school’s COVID19 Response Plan.
Any changes to the schools existing emergency procedures should be documented and incorporated into the school’s safety statement.
Schools should also review their existing risk assessments to consider any new risks that arise due to the school’s COVID19 Response Plan.
Any changes to the school’s current risk assessments should also be documented and be incorporated into the schools safety statement.
First Aid/emergency procedure
The standard First Aid/emergency procedure shall continue to apply in schools.
In an emergency or in case of a serious incident, schools should call for an ambulance or the fire brigade on 112/999 giving details of location and type of medical incident.
Access to School and Contact Log
Access to the school building will be in line with agreed school procedures.
Arrangement for necessary visitors such as contractors and parents will be restricted to essential purposes and limited to those who have obtained prior approval from the principal.
The Department of Education Inspectorate may also need to visit schools and centres for education to support them as appropriate in the implementation of public health advice relating to creating a safe learning and working environment for all.
The prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a crucial step in restricting the spread of the virus and protecting the health and safety of the individuals themselves and other staff, contractors and visitors at the workplace.
A detailed sign in/sign out log of those entering the school facilities should be maintained.
The school should maintain a log of staff and students contacts.
A sample contact log is available at Appendix 5.
The Data Protection Commission has provided guidance on the data protection implications of the return to work protocols.
Schools are reminded that all school records and data must be maintained and processed in compliance with the GDPR and the Data Protection Acts.
The responsibility for compliance with the legislation rests with each school (or ETB) in their role as data controller.
Infection Prevention Control Measures To prevent Introduction and Spread of COVID19 in Schools
One of the key messages to manage the risks of COVID19 is to do everything practical to avoid the introduction of COVID19 into the school.
If infection is not introduced it cannot be spread.
The risk of spreading the infection once introduced exists in all interpersonal interactions; student student, teacher teacher and teacher student, and must be managed in all settings.
A range of essential control measures have been implemented to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID 19 virus and to protect the safety, health and welfare of staff, students, parents and visitors as far as possible within the school.
The control measures shall continue to be reviewed and updated as required on an ongoing basis.
It is critical that staff, students, parents and visitors are aware of, and adhere to, the control measures outlined and that they fully cooperate with all health and safety requirements.
Staff, should note that they have a legal obligation under Section 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to comply with health and safety requirements and to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves, their colleagues and other parties within the workplace.
Promote awareness of COVID19 symptoms (details at Section 5.1);
Advise staff and students that have symptoms not to attend school, to phone their doctor and to follow HSE guidance on selfisolation;
Advise staff and students to selfisolate or restrict their movements at home if they display any signs or symptoms of COVID19 and contact their family doctor to arrange a test
Advise staff and students not to return to or attend school in the event of the following:
if they are identified by the HSE as a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID 19
if they live with someone who has symptoms of the virus
If they have travelled outside of Ireland; in such instances staff are advised to consult and follow latest Government advice in relation to foreign travel.
Advise staff and students that develop symptoms at school to bring this to the attention of the Principal promptly;
Ensure that staff and students know the protocol for managing a suspected case of COVID19 in school (details at Section 8);
Advise staff and students to cooperate with any public health officials and the school for contact tracing purposes and follow any public health advice in the event of a case or outbreak in the school;
Everyone entering the school building needs to perform hand hygiene with a hand sanitiser;
Visitors to the school during the day should be by prior arrangement and should be received at a specific contract point;
Physical distancing of 2 metres should be maintained between staff and visitors where possible.
Know the Symptoms of COVID19
In order to prevent the spread of COVID19 it is important to know and recognise the symptoms.
High temperature
Cough
Shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
Loss of smell, of taste or distortion of taste
Infection with the virus that causes COVID19 can cause illness, ranging from mild to severe, and, in some cases, can be fatal.
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to show.
They can be similar to symptoms of cold and flu.
Common symptoms of coronavirus include:
a fever (high temperature 38 degrees Celsius or above).
a new cough this can be any kind of cough, not just dry.
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties.
loss or change in your sense of smell or taste – this means you’ve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal
If you have any common symptoms of COVID19 (coronavirus), selfisolate (stay in your room) and phone your family doctor straight away to see if you need a COVID19 test.
Other people in your household will need to restrict their movements (stay at home).
Getting an early diagnosis means, you can get the help you need and take steps to avoid spreading the virus, if you have it.
For the complete list of symptoms, please refer to the HSE Website.
COVID19 Tracker App
COVID Tracker app is a free and easytouse mobile phone app that will:
alert you if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID19 (coronavirus)
keep other app users safe by alerting them if you test positive for COVID19 give you advice on what to do if you have symptoms
You can download the free app from Apple's AppStore or the GooglePlay store
Respiratory Hygiene
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
This means covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your bent elbow when you cough or sneeze.
Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and safely into a nearby bin.
By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID19.
Hand Hygiene
Staff and students should understand why hand hygiene is important.
Schools should promote good hygiene and display posters throughout the schools on how to wash your hands.
Follow the HSE guidelines on handwashing:
Hand hygiene can be achieved by hand washing or use of a hand sanitiser (when hands look clean).
Use of hand hygiene facilities including wash hand basins needs to be managed so as to avoid congregation of students and staff waiting to use wash hand basins and hand sanitisers.
There is a requirement for access to hand washing facilities after activities that are likely to soil hands, for example playing outside or certain sporting activities as hand sanitiser does not work on dirty hands.
Hand sanitiser dispensers can be deployed more readily at exit and entry points of schools and classrooms and care should be taken to clean up any hand sanitizer spills to prevent risks of falls.
Warm water is preferable to hot or cold water for hand washing but if the plumbing system only supplies cold water, a soap that emulsifies easily in cold water should be used.
Wash hand basins, running water, liquid soap and hand drying facilities should be provided in all toilets, kitchens and any food preparation areas.
Hand washing facilities should be maintained in good condition and supplies of soap and towels should be topped up regularly to encourage everyone to use them.
Hot air dryers are an acceptable alternative for hand drying but must be regularly maintained.
There is no evidence that hand dryers are associated with increased risk of transmission of COVID19.
Posters displaying hand washing techniques and promoting hand washing should be placed on walls adjacent to washing facilities and can be laminated or placed in a plastic sleeve.
Hand sanitiser is suitable for use for hand hygiene when hands are not visibly soiled (look clean).
Evidence of effectiveness is best for alcohol based hand rubs but nonalcohol based hand rubs can be used too.
When hand rubs/gels are being used in school care should be taken to ensure that students do not ingest them as they are flammable and toxic.
Alcohol based sanitiser must not be stored or used near heat or naked flame
Frequency of Hand Hygiene
Students and staff should perform hand hygiene:
On arrival at school;
Before eating or drinking;
After using the toilet;
After playing outdoors;
When their hands are physically dirty;
When they cough or sneeze.
The Department has arranged for a drawdown framework to be established to enable schools purchase handsanitisers and any other necessary PPE supplies for use in the school.
The Department will provide funding for the costs associated with the hand sanitising and PPE requirements in schools.
Physical Distancing
Physical distancing can be usefully applied in a post primary school setting allowing for some flexibility when needed.
It must be applied in a practical way to recognise that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue.
Care should be taken to avoid generating tension or potential conflict.
It is also recognised that it is not always possible for staff to maintain physical distance from students and it is not appropriate that they would always be expected to do so where this could have a detrimental impact on the student
if a student sustains an injury and requires first aid.
However where possible staff should maintain a minimum of 1m distance and where possible 2m.
They should also take measures to avoid close contact at face to face level such as remaining standing rather than sitting beside/crouching down.
Physical distancing falls into two categories:
Increasing separation
Decreasing interaction
Given that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school; and (iv) student numbers; schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfigurations / operational changes necessary to maintain physical distancing.
In recognition that a ‘one size fits all’ approach would not be appropriate as schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate configuration for their school, the Department has developed a Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020/21 School Year.
The Framework sets out a suite of available measures that must be implemented at individual school level to the greatest possible extent.
The suite of measures set out in the Framework are:
Reconfigure class spaces to maximise physical distancing;
Utilising and reconfiguring all available space in the school in order to maximise physical distancing;
Review Timetables;
Reconfiguring Classes;
Consider Use of Live Streaming within the School; and
Accessing available spaces within the local community
A link to the “Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020/21 School Year” is provided here.
You can see a link to illustrated classroom layouts to maintain social distancing here.
Decreasing interaction
The extent to which decreasing interaction is possible in a post primary school will depend on the school setting and a commonsense approach is required recognising the limits to which this can be achieved between students.
In post primary schools physical distancing of 2m where possible or at least 1m should be maintained between desks or between individual students or staff.
As far as possible and practical, students would remain in the classroom and teachers would move between rooms.
As far as possible and practical students would be assigned to a main class cohort which would remain in the classroom for most subjects, with teachers moving between rooms.
Where possible and practical double classes should be planned to minimise movement during the day.
Where students have an elective subject they would move quickly into the new class and would be seated with members of their class cohort, observing as much physical distance as possible.
Hand washing and/or sanitising would be required when moving between classes by teachers and students.
Physical distancing between the teacher and class would be observed.
Where movement of class groups between rooms is required it should be planned to minimise interaction with other class groups.
Limit interaction on arrival and departure and in hallways and other shared areas.
Social physical contact (hand to hand greetings, hugs) should be discouraged.
Where students need to move about within the classroom to perform activities (access to a shared resource) it should be organized to the greatest degree possible to minimise congregation at the shared resource.
Staff and students should avoid sharing of personal items.
Where teaching and learning involves use of keyboards or tablets, the contact surface of the device should be cleaned regularly and hand hygiene encouraged.
Physical Distancing outside of the classroom and within the school
School drop off/collection
Arrangements for dropping off/collecting students should be arranged to maintain physical distancing of 2m where possible.
Walking/cycling to school should be encouraged as much as possible.
Aim of any arrangements is to avoid congregation of people at the school gates where physical distancing requirements may not be respected.
Staggered drop off/pick up should be considered where practical and feasible.
If schools have additional access points, consideration may be given to whether they can be used to reduce congestion.
Students should head straight to their designated learning space/classroom.
A distance of 2m is recommended for physical distancing by staff.
This is particularly relevant to distancing between adults when they are not engaged in teaching such as the staff room and arriving to work.
If 2m cannot be maintained in staff groups, as much as distance as is possible and updated guidance on face covering should be observed.
Physical distancing should be observed between staff members within the staff room through the use of staggered breaks etc.
At post primary level consideration could be given to formation of staff “pods” or teams who work together and take breaks together.
Staff meetings should be held remotely or in small groups or in large spaces to facilitate physical distancing.
Implement no hand shaking policy.
Minimise gathering of school staff at the beginning or end of the school day.
Staff can rotate between areas/classes but this should be minimized where possible.
Ensure physical distancing is applied in canteen facilities
Stagger canteen use and extend serving times to align with class groupings.
Implement a queue management system.
Make sure students clean their hands before and after entering the canteen area.
Briefly passing someone in a hall is very unlikely to contribute significantly to the spread of infection if people do not have physical contact and avoid informal group discussions.
Ventilation
The Department has published guidance setting out the practical steps for good ventilation in accordance with public health advice ‘Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools’ The guidance sets out an overall approach for schools that windows should be open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g.
during breaktimes or lunchtimes (assuming not in use) and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use.
The guidance provides that good ventilation can be achieved in classrooms without causing discomfort, particularly during cold weather.
Use of PPE in Schools
The Department has published “Guidance to Post Primary Schools on PPE consumables and equipment” on gov.ie/backtoschool.
This provides schools with the information needed on the appropriate quantities of PPE consumables and equipment to support the full and safe reopening of schools.
The updated advice from the HPSC to the Department of Education has recommended that face coverings should be worn by staff members where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from other staff, parents, essential visitors or students.
The Department has accepted this recommendation.
Accordingly, it is now a requirement for face coverings to be worn by staff members where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from other staff, parents, essential visitors or students.
Please see note re medical grade masks.
PPE will also need to be used at certain work activities or work areas.
These might include roles such as:
Performing intimate care
Where a suspected case of COVID19 is identified while the school is in operation Where staff are particularly vulnerable to infection but are not in the list of those categorised as people in very high risk groups, or may be living with people who are in a very high risk category;
Administering first aid
Parent Teacher meetings
Where staff provide healthcare to children with medical needs in the school environment they should apply standard precautions as per usual practice.
Reception Areas
Consideration should be given to the use of Perspex in reception areas where it is not possible for staff to maintain a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students.
Minor works funding grant can be used for this purpose.
Masks/Face Coverings
Cloth face coverings act as a barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from travelling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the face covering coughs, sneezes, talks or raises their voice.
Cloth face coverings are therefore intended to prevent transmission of the virus from the wearer (who may not know that they are infected) to those with whom they come into close contact.
It is therefore a requirement that teachers, staff and students attending post primary schools wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained.
In certain situations the use of clear visors should be considered, for example staff interacting with students with hearing difficulties or learning difficulties.
All students on the post primary transport scheme should be asked to wear face coverings unless there is a good reason not to do so.
Cloth face coverings should not be worn by any of the following groups:
Any person with difficulty breathing
Any person who is unconscious or incapacitated
Any person who is unable to remove the facecovering without assistance
Any person who has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the face covering, for example persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.
All staff and students wearing face coverings should be reminded to not touch the face covering and to wash or sanitise their hands (using hand sanitiser) before putting on and after taking off the face covering.
Information should be provided on the proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings
All teachers and staff should be aware that they should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a face covering.
Face coverings should be stored in a space designated for each student that is separate from others when not being worn (e.g., in individually labelled containers or bags).
Cloth face coverings should be washed after every day of use and/or before being used again, or if visibly soiled.
Face coverings should not be worn if they are wet.
A wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe.
Schools should consider having additional disposable face coverings available for students, teachers, and staff in case a backup face covering is needed during the day.
Whilst staff may wish to utilize their own face covering on a daytoday basis, schools should have available a stock of additional disposable or multiuse face coverings, or if appropriate face visors, available for staff in case a backup face covering is needed throughout the day or where required on an ongoing basis.
Medical Grade Masks
Schools must provide medical grade masks in the EN14683 category to all SNAs and teachers in special schools and special classes and those staff by necessity that need to be in close and continued proximity with pupils with intimate care needs.
Wearing a face covering or mask does not negate the need to stay at home if symptomatic.
Gloves
The use of disposable gloves in the school by students or staff is not generally appropriate but may be necessary for matters such as cleaning, intimate care settings or when administering first aid.
Routine use does not protect the wearer and may expose others to risk from contaminated gloves.
Routine use of disposable gloves is not a substitute for hand hygiene.
Aprons
Aprons may also be appropriate in certain circumstances including for intimate care needs or for staff assigned to cleaning an area where a suspected or confirmed case of COVID19 was present.
Impact of COVID19 on certain school activities
The Department will work with stakeholders to provide more detailed advice on certain school activities in advance of school reopening.
Choir/Music Performance
Choir practices/performances and music practices/performances involving wind instruments may pose a higher level of risk and special consideration should be given to how they are held ensuring that the room is wellventilated and the distance between performers is maintained.
Sport Activities
Schools should refer to the HPSC guidance on Return to Sport.
Shared Equipment
Art – Where possible students should be encouraged to have their own individual art and equipment supplies.
Electronics – Shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards should be cleaned between use and consideration could be given to the use of wipeable covers for electronics to facilitate cleaning.
Musical Equipment/Instruments – To the greatest extent possible, instruments should not be shared between students and if sharing is required, the instruments should be
Library Policy – Where practical students should have their own books.
Textbooks that are shared should be covered in a wipeable plastic covering that can be wiped with a suitable household cleaning agent between uses.
Students should be encouraged to perform hand hygiene after using any shared item.
Shared Sports Equipment – Minimise equipment sharing and clean shared equipment between uses by different people.
Hygiene and Cleaning in Schools
The Department of Education has provide additional funding to schools to support the enhanced cleaning required to minimise the risks of COVID19.
Details of the funding supports will be provided to schools by way of circular and will be updated as required.
The specific advice in relation to school cleaning is set out in the HPSC advice and is covered in the induction training.
This advice sets out the cleaning regime required to support schools to prevent COVID19 infections and the enhanced cleaning required in the event of a suspected cases of COVID19.
Schools are asked to carefully read and understand the cleaning advice and to apply that to all areas of the school as appropriate.
Schools are reminded to take particular care of the hygiene arrangements for hand washing and toilet facilities.
In summary, each school setting should be cleaned at least once per day.
Additional cleaning if available should be focused on frequently touched surfaces – door handles, hand rails, chairs/arm rests, communal eating areas, sink and toilet facilities.
If students are moving between classrooms consideration may be given to appropriate cleaning products being provided to enable them to wipe down their desk, chair and surface before leaving the room.
All staff will have access to cleaning products and will be required to maintain cleanliness of their own work area.
Under no circumstances should these cleaning materials be removed from the building.
Staff should thoroughly clean and disinfect their work area before and after use each day.
There will be regular collection of used waste disposal bags from offices and other areas within the school facility.
Shower facilities shall not be available for use by staff or students due to the increased risk associated with communal shower facilities and areas.
This shall be reviewed in line with government guidance.
Staff must use and clean their own equipment and utensils (cup, cutlery, plate etc.).
Cleaning/Disinfecting rooms where a student/staff member with suspected COVID19 was present
The rooms should be cleaned as soon as practicable possible.
Once the room is vacated the room should not be reused until it has been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and all surfaces are dry.
Disinfection only works on things that are clean.
When disinfection is required it is always in addition to cleaning.
Person/s assigned to cleaning should avoid touching their face while they are cleaning and household gloves and a plastic apron.
Clean the environment and furniture using disposable cleaning cloths and a household detergent followed by disinfection with a chlorine based product (household bleach).
Pay special attention to frequently touched surfaces, the back of chairs, couches, door handles and any surfaces that are visibly soiled with body fluids.
Once the room has been cleaned and disinfected and all surfaces are dry, the room can be reused.
If a student or staff diagnosed with COVID19 spent time in a communal area like a canteen, play area or if they used the toilet or bathroom facilities, then the areas should be cleaned with household detergent followed by a disinfectant (as outlined in the HPSC interim health advice) as soon as is practically possible.
Dealing with a Suspected Case of COVID19
Staff or students should not attend school if displaying any symptoms of COVID19.
The following outlines how a school should deal with a suspected case that may arise in a school setting.
A designated isolation area should be identified within the school building.
The possibility of having more than one person displaying signs of COVID19 should be considered and a contingency plan for dealing with additional cases put in place.
The designated isolation area should be behind a closed door and away from other staff and students.
If a staff member/student displays symptoms of COVID19 while at school the following are the procedures to be implemented:
If the person with the suspected case is a student, the parents/guardians should be contacted immediately;
Isolate the person and have a procedure in place to accompany the individual to the designated isolation area via the isolation route, keeping at least 2 metres away from the symptomatic person and also making sure that others maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from the symptomatic person at all times;
The isolation area does not have to be a room but if it is not a room it should be 2m away from others in the room;
If it is not possible to maintain a distance of 2m a staff member caring for a student should wear a face covering or mask.
Gloves should not be used as the virus does not pass through skin;
Provide a mask for the person presenting with symptoms.
He/she should wear the mask if in a common area with other people or while exiting the premises; Assess whether the individual who is displaying symptoms can immediately be directed to go home/be brought home by parents who call their doctor and continue selfisolation at home;
Facilitate the person presenting with symptoms remaining in isolation if they cannot immediately go home and facilitate them calling their doctor.
The individual should avoid touching people, surfaces and objects.
Advice should be given to the person presenting with symptoms to cover their mouth and nose with the disposable tissue provided when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in the waste bag provided;
If the person is well enough to go home, arrange for them to be transported home by a family member, as soon as possible and advise them to inform their general practitioner by phone of their symptoms.
Public transport of any kind should not be used;
If they are too unwell to go home or advice is required, contact 999 or 112 and inform them that the sick person is a COVID19 suspect;
Carry out an assessment of the incident which will form part of determining followup actions and recovery;
Arrange for appropriate cleaning of the isolation area and work areas involved – (details at Section 7)
The HSE will inform any staff/parents who have come into close contact with a diagnosed case via the contact tracing process.
The HSE will contact all relevant persons where a diagnosis of COVID19 is made.
The instructions of the HSE should be followed and staff and student confidentiality is essential at all times.
School staff should be encouraged to download the HSE COVID19 tracker app to assist Public Health for contract tracing purposes.
Both in and out of the school setting (see section 5.1).

Appendix 3 Lead Worker Representative – Post primary Schools
The Work Safely Protocol is designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID19 in the workplace.
The Protocol was developed following discussion and agreement between the Government, Trade Unions and Employers at the Labour Employer Economic Forum.
The Protocol provides for the appointment of a Lead Worker Representative (LWR) in each workplace.
The LWR will work in collaboration with the employer to assist in the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of COVID 19 and monitor adherence to those measures and to be involved in communicating the health advice around COVID19 in the workplace.
The purpose of this section is to set out the provisions in respect of the LWR in schools.
The operation of these arrangements will operate for the 2020/21 school year and will be kept under review by the parties.
This document should be read in conjunction with:
The Work Safely Protocol;
the Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during COVID19;
COVID19 Response Plan for Post primary Schools (available on the Department of Education website).
Collaborative Approach
Responsibility for the development and implementation of the COVID19 Response Plan and the associated infection prevention control measures lies primarily with the Board of Management/ Education and Training Board and school management.
Strong communication and a shared collaborative approach is key to protecting against the spread of COVID19 in schools, and looking after the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and students.
Adherence to the Work Safety Protocol will only be achieved if everyone has a shared obligation in implementing the measures contained within the Protocol in their place of work.
If a staff member has any concerns or observations in relation to the COVID19 Response Plan, control measures or the adherence to such measures by staff, students or others, they should contact the Lead Worker Representative who will engage with school management.
Role of the Lead Worker Representative
Represent all staff in the workplace regardless of role, and be aware of specific issues that may arise in respect of different staff cohorts;
Work collaboratively with school management to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of employees in relation to COVID19; Keep up to date with the latest COVID19 public health advice;
In conjunction with school management, promote good hygiene practices such as washing hands regularly and maintaining good respiratory etiquette along with maintaining social distancing in accordance with public health advice;
Assist school management with the implementation of measures to suppress COVID 19 in the workplace in line with the Work Safely Protocol and current public health advice;
In conjunction with school management, monitor adherence to infection prevention control measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID19;
Conduct regular reviews of safety measures;
Report any issues of concern immediately to school management and keep records of such issues and actions taken to rectify them;

Does a LWR have any legal responsibilities?
A Lead Worker Representative does not have any duties in relation to COVID19 other than those that apply to employees generally.
In other words, the LWR is not responsible for the control measures within an organisation, which remains the employer’s responsibility.
Every school will appoint one Lead Worker Representative.
In schools with more than 40 staff, a second Lead Worker Representative will be appointed.
Selection of Lead Worker Representative(s)
The school staff are entitled to select staff members for the LWR position(s).
The LWR(s) represent all staff in the workplace regardless of role and must be aware of specific issues that may arise in respect of different staff cohorts.
In this regard, where a school has two LWRs, the roles should be spread between teaching and nonteaching staff where feasible
All staff are entitled to volunteer for the LWR role and have their name put forward for election where necessary.
The process for the selection and appointment of the LWR(s) is that management will seek expressions of interest from all staff in the first instance.
A template email for this purpose is attached.
If an election is necessary, all school staff members will have an equal vote to select the LWR(s).”
Supports for the Lead Worker Representative/s
The LWR(s) shall be entitled to:
Be provided with information and training in respect of their role [further detail to be provided];
Be consulted by school management on the control measures being put in place by the school to minimise the risk of being exposed to COVID19;

Be provided with the necessary facilities to enable them to consult with employees or prepare any submissions or reports.
These might include access to a meeting room, photocopier, communications and equipment.
Where the LWR is a teacher, the LWR will receive protected time of 2 hours per week from timetable to enable them to carry out their duties in that role.
In the rare instances where the appointment of a teacher selected for the LWR would cause curricular/timetabling difficulties which cannot be resolved, school management will examine internal and external possibilities to enable the teacher’s appointment as LWR.
Where the matter cannot be resolved, management will set out the reasons why this is the case.
In this circumstance, an alternative individual must be appointed as LWR.
Where the LWR is an SNA, 66 of the “72 hours” will be utilised by the LWR to carry out their duties in that role.
Where the LWR is a Secretary or Caretaker, a reprioritisation of duties by school management should be carried out to afford the staff member sufficient time to carry out their duties in that role within the scope of their normal contracted hours.
Where an issue of concern is identified by the LWR (or is notified to the LWR by a staff member), the LWR should bring this to the attention of the Principal.
Action points for addressing the issue should where possible be agreed between the LWR and the Principal.
Staff should be informed of the outcome.
If agreement cannot be reached, the LWR should notify the Board of Management (Chairperson of the BoM in the first instance)/ Education and Training Board head office of the issue.

Appendix 1 – COVID19 Business Continuity Checklist
Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment – Enterprise Information Centre
The personal and economic toll that COVID19 has taken on every family, community and business is unprecedented.
We have seen businesses throughout the country respond with determination and an ability to adapt in what have been extremely difficult circumstances.
The government must do everything it can to help these businesses reopen and get people back to work.
The July Stimulus will form a major part of our response.
It is our plan to help our country recover, to repair the damage that has been done and to restore confidence and prosperity.
Step by step, we will help businesses get back on their feet.
This document is intended to act as a practical guide to help businesses contend with the challenges posed by COVID19, by setting out all the relevant information in one place.
It includes information on grants, low cost loans, vouchers and training opportunities and I hope you find it useful.
My Department is also operating an Enterprise Information Centre call centre to advise businesses that are affected by COVID19.
The Call Centre can be contacted at
Supports for Businesses Impacted by COVID19
The COVID19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for businesses in Ireland and across the globe.
These circumstances have presented great difficulties for employers and employees alike.
The Government is continuing to address the changing situation and to assist companies and has introduced a range of measures and supports in this regard.
This online, downloadable Guide was compiled to provide a comprehensive resource for businesses trying to manage their way through this current situation.
This Guide contains detailed information on a huge range of supports from this Department and other Government Departments and Agencies.
To ensure ease of access to this information, the Guide is divided into 6 sections and also includes an Appendix which contains a COVID19 Business Continuity Checklist which outlines some of the key risks to businesses as well as preparatory actions that can be taken to respond.
Part 1 highlights the supports available from Revenue, such as Warehousing of COVID19 debt, Reduction in VAT rates, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).
Part 2 provides information on the supports available from the Department of Social Protection.
The supports include the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Enterprise Support Grant and the Short Time Work Support.
Part 3 sets out in detail the business supports that are available, ranging from loans to grants to vouchers to mentoring.
These include the €450m Strategic Banking Corporation Ireland (SBCI) COVID19 Working Capital Scheme, Enterprise Ireland supports the €5,000 Business Financial Planning Grant as well as supports from the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) like the Trading Online Voucher and the Mentor Programme.
Part 4 of the Guide outlines other Government supports that are available to businesses.
Details are provided on the Commercial Rates Waiver and the Annual Filing of Returns.
In addition, links are provided to other important resources like the NSAI Workplace and Retail Protection and Improvement Guides.

As the COVID19 situation changes, Government supports also change to address new difficulties and provide solutions and guidance.
Engage with Revenue
If you have concerns about your ability to pay your tax liabilities speak to the Revenue Commissioners, who have advised:
"On an ongoing basis, Revenue engages with viable businesses experiencing temporary cashflow or trading difficulties that affect the timely payment of tax.
Revenue works very successfully with businesses that engage early to resolve their tax payment difficulties.
Revenue will engage with any viable business that experiences temporary cashflow difficulties, including difficulties arising from exceptional circumstances such as the COVID19 (Coronavirus) outbreak.” Revenue
It is vitally important that businesses affected by the pandemic and unable to pay tax liabilities as they fall due, continue to file their tax returns on time so that they may take advantage of these forbearance measures.
Revenue has also posted advice for businesses experiencing trading difficulties as a result of COVID 19.
This includes information on tax returns, the application of late payment interest, debt enforcement, tax clearance and customs.
For more information, visit Revenue’s COVID19 information and advice for taxpayers and agents and Revenue measures to assist SMEs experiencing cashflow difficulties as a result of COVID19
The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), provides a flatrate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer’s payroll.
The EWSS, operated by Revenue, has replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and is expected to run until 30 June 2021.
COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)
The COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) offers support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels as a result of restrictions imposed on them in response to COVID19.
Eligible businesses can make a claim to Revenue for a payment known as an Advance Credit for Trading Expenses (ACTE).
An ACTE is payable for each week a business is affected by the restrictions.
The ACTE is equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 up to €20,000, plus 5% on turnover over €20,000.
In the case of new businesses, the turnover is based on the average actual weekly turnover in 2020.
The ACTE is subject to a maximum weekly payment of €5,000.
Revenue ‘Warehousing’ of COVID19 related tax debt for businesses
Businesses that have had to close or have been significantly impacted by the restrictions will not be able to enter into arrangements to clear the COVIDrelated tax debt, pay their normal trade and other nonRevenue creditors, make any necessary restructuring to deal with the new trading arrangements in the context of social distancing, build up their stock, etc.
In that context, Revenue will Warehouse Deferred Tax Liabilities associated with the COVID19 crisis.
This will represent a direct support for affected businesses where a commitment to a phased payment arrangement is not possible.
Arrangements will be put in place to allow debt that cannot be paid during the COVIDrelated period, to be warehoused interestfree for a year from recommencement of trading, during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue in respect of the debt.
Prior to the expiry of the warehousing period, the business will be expected to engage with Revenue to reach an agreement on an exit strategy more suited to the specific business needs and the need for continued viability.
The scheme will apply to businesses in all sectors of the economy who have been negatively impacted by COVID19.
For further details please visit Revenue: Warehousing of VAT and PAYE (Employer) Debts
Reduction of VAT Rates
VAT rate reduction from 13.5% to 9%
A VAT rate reduction from 13.5% to 9% applies from 1 November 2020 in recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the hospitality and tourism sector.

This fund, to be known as the Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund (PSRF), will have €2 billion in total capital and will be made available through a subportfolio within ISIF.
The PSRF will focus on investment in large and medium enterprises employing more than 250 employees or with annual turnover in excess of €50 million.
ISIF may consider investing in enterprises below these levels if they are assessed to be of substantial scale and of significant importance at national or regional level.
the fund will act as an accelerator, investing on a commercial basis in businesses that can meet the investment requirements and can use ISIF investment to return to longterm viability.
investments can be across the range of instruments from senior debt, hybrid instruments to equity, and can be tailored to take account of the particular circumstances of each investee.
This will enable businesses to access the capital they need in the most appropriate form that best suits their individual needs.
in making investments, ISIF will seek to maximise the quantum of additional capital that the investee business can access from its existing shareholders and banks, from potential new co investors and from European sources (such as the European Investment Bank), thereby minimising the amount of ISIF capital that may be needed.

On September 15 2020 the Government published the Resilience and Recovery 20202021: Plan for Living with COVID19.
Ireland is moving from a shortterm emergency response approach to a mediumterm approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID19 has inflicted on society.
The Framework for Restrictive Measures will help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, while managing the behaviour of the virus.
The Framework consists of 5 Levels.
The lower Levels will be activated when there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated outbreaks, low community transmission.
The higher Levels will be used to deal with higher incidences of the disease.
It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at a different Level to the National Level, depending on the incidence of the virus in that particular region or county.
The 5 Level Framework can be viewed online: Resilience and Recovery 20202021: Plan for Living with COVID19.

Appendix 1 – COVID19 Business Continuity Checklist
The following is a checklist of some of the key risks to the continuity of your business activities during the outbreak of COVID19 and of preparatory actions that can be taken to respond.
Many of the actions are the same as you would have prepared during any type of similar threat such as preparations for influenza pandemics.
Your organisation should consider appointing a planning coordinator and/or team with defined responsibilities and budget for planning and for preparedness.
A deputy should also be appointed.
If your organisation already has a business continuity planning process, you should consider addressing COVID19 within that process.
In relation to COVID19, it is particularly important that your organisation uses the national resources, posters and guidance that are available and updated on a regular basis to reflect the rapidly emerging situation.
The links to COVID19 resources are available here:
